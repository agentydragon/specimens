# Parallel critics findings summary

This summarizes final-only outputs from parallel Codex critic runs under:
- /Users/mpokorny/code/ducktape/llm/adgn_llm/specimens/2025-08-30-crush_internal_db/parallel_all

Each section lists only reported findings for that chunk; files/subdirs with no issues are grouped at the end.

## internal/lsp
- internal/lsp/client.go
  - Early bailout (loop guard):
    prefer early continue rather than wrapping the whole body. Lines: 426–434
- internal/lsp/watcher/watcher.go
  - No one-off variables:
    inline temporary isMatch used only for immediate branching/return.
    Lines: 570–577, 599–603, 621–623, 626–631, 656–658, 663–665, 671–673, 726–729
  - No unnecessary nesting: flatten trivial guard chains. Lines: 68–71, 76–79

## internal/app
- internal/app/lsp_events.go
  - Early bailout: use early return instead of wrapping entire function body.
    Lines: 88–101

## e2e (tests)
- e2e/mock_openai_responses.go
  - No unnecessary line breaks: two consecutive blank lines at EOF;
    keep at most one. Lines: 219–220
- e2e/scenario.go
  - No unnecessary nesting: flatten nested guard around env parsing;
    combine using Atoi’s result. Lines: 197–201
