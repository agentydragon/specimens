rationale: |-
  When OldString is empty Run() creates the file (createNewFile) but then still falls through and calls
  replaceContent which treats empty old_string as a literal match, causing "appears multiple times" errors and
  masking the successful create. Make the branches mutually exclusive (else-if / early return) or otherwise
  ensure replaceContent is not invoked after a create.
