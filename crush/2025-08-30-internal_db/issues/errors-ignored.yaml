rationale: |
  Errors are ignored in operational code, hiding failures and making diagnosis difficult.

  Example
  - internal/tui/tui.go: List sessions in a command handler discards the error (`allSessions,
  _ := a.app.Sessions.List(context.Background())`).

  Why it matters
  - Swallowing errors causes silent feature breakage and confusing UX; upstream systems cannot react or present
  actionable messages.

  Acceptance criteria
  - Do not ignore errors. Handle or log explicitly; in TUI, return an errMsg so the UI can inform the user.
  - If the code cannot proceed sensibly without the value,
  fail fast. Prefer returning an error; if you absolutely
  cannot propagate, panic is acceptable over silently swallowing.
  - Prefer passing a caller context (with cancellation) rather than context.Background() where possible.
