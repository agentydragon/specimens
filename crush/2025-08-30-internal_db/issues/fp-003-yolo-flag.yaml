rationale: |
  A past critique suggested renaming the CLI flag `--yolo` (and local variable `yolo`) to a more
  descriptive predicate such as `--skip-permission-requests`. This is a false positive.

  "yolo mode" is intentionally branded and used consistently across the user-facing docs and UX
  as a short, memorable alias for the dangerous mode that automatically accepts permission requests.
  The flag help already documents its semantics clearly: "Automatically accept all permissions (dangerous
  mode)".

  It is acceptable to keep the public flag name `--yolo` as a tongue-in-cheek user-facing label while
  keeping any internal semantic name (e.g., skip-permissions) in code where helpful. No change required.
