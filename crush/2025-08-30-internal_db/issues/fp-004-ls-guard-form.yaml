rationale: |
  A reviewer suggested refactoring the following code in internal/fsext/ls.go
  to combine the nested dir check and skip check into a single condition.

  Original form:
    if d.IsDir() {
        if walker.ShouldSkip(path) {
            return filepath.SkipDir
        }
        return nil
    }

  Suggested combined form:
    if d.IsDir() && walker.ShouldSkip(path) {
        return filepath.SkipDir
    }
    if d.IsDir() {
        return nil
    }

  This is a false positive. Both forms are acceptable; the original nested form
  is equally clear and arguably preferable for readability by making the
  directory-special-case explicit. Do not require this change. If desired,
  lightweight helper extraction (e.g., isDirAndShouldSkip) is fine, but
  forcing this stylistic rewrite is unnecessary.
