rationale: |
  A reviewer suggested refactoring the cleanup loop in internal/app/app.go from:

    for _, cleanup := range app.cleanupFuncs {
        if cleanup != nil {
            cleanup()
        }
    }

  to an early-bailout style using `continue` when cleanup == nil. This is a false positive. The
  existing form is brief and clear; rewriting to use `continue` yields no measurable improvement and
  is not necessary. Keep as-is.
