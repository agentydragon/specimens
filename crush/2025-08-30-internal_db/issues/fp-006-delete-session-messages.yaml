rationale: |
  A reviewer suggested converting a small loop that performs a conditional delete
  into an early-bailout (continue) style to save one indentation level:

    for _, message := range messages {
        if message.SessionID == sessionID {
            err = s.Delete(ctx, message.ID)
            if err != nil {
                return err
            }
        }
    }

  Both forms are acceptable: using `if message.SessionID != sessionID { continue }` is valid, but the original
  form is
  equally clear and idiomatic. No change is necessary; retain whichever form reads better to maintainers.
