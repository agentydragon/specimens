rationale: |
  Glob tool documentation claims sorting by modification time, but implementation sorts by path length.

  Documentation at line 18 (in tool description shown to LLM agent):
  "returning matching paths sorted by modification time (newest first)"

  Actual implementation at lines 164-166:
  sort.SliceStable(matches, func(i, j int) bool {
      return len(matches[i]) < len(matches[j])
  })

  The code sorts by path length (shortest paths first), not by file modification time. No mtime checking or stat
  calls
  are
  present.

  Impact:
  - Agent receives misleading tool description and may make incorrect planning decisions
  - Agent might expect recently modified files when developing iterative search strategies
  - Agent gets shortest-path-first ordering (e.g., "main.go" before "internal/app/very/nested/file.go")
  - Truncation at 100 files returns shortest paths, not most relevant/recent files

  Fix: Either implement mtime sorting (stat files, sort by mtime desc) or update tool description to accurately
  describe
  length-based sorting.
