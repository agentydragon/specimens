rationale: |
  LSPConfig.Disabled field has inverted JSON serialization: the Go field is named `Disabled` but serializes as
  `"enabled"`
  in JSON.

  Field definition at internal/config/config.go:127:
  - Go field name: `Disabled bool`
  - JSON tag: `json:"enabled,omitempty"`
  - Schema description: "Whether this LSP server is disabled"

  This creates confusing inverted logic:
  - Setting `{"enabled": true}` in config JSON sets `Disabled = true` in Go (backwards!)
  - Setting `{"enabled": false}` in config JSON sets `Disabled = false` in Go (backwards!)

  The Go code uses `.Disabled` correctly (e.g., internal/tui/components/lsp/lsp.go:63 checks `if
  l.LSP.Disabled`), so
  the
  JSON tag is wrong.

  Fix: Change JSON tag to `json:"disabled,omitempty"` to match the field name and schema description, or rename
  the Go
  field to `Enabled` and update the schema description to match.

  This appears to be an incomplete refactoring where the field was partially renamed from one polarity to the
  other.
