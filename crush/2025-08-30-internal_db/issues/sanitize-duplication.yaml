rationale: |-
  Both tool.go and renderer.go perform identical sanitization of Bash command strings (replace "
  " with space and tabs with 4 spaces). Factor into a shared helper (e.g., sanitizeInlineCommand) to avoid
  duplicated
  logic and ensure consistent sanitization across UI renderers and copy-to-clipboard output.
