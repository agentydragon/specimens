  Ambiguous or overly terse local/var names reduce readability. Prefer descriptive names that encode
  units/meaning
  (e.g.,
  address/storedAddr, compressEnabled, CRUSH_PROFILE env var semantics).

  note: addr atomic.Value stored as `v`; prefer naming like storedAddr/address in accessors to avoid confusion.

  note: v variable read from CRUSH_PROFILE is ambiguous; syscall/env var pstr should be named pprofPortStr or similar.

  note: bool `b` used to set Wire.Compress; rename to compressEnabled to highlight units/purpose.
