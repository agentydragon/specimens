# Specimens Format Specification

Technical reference for the specimens dataset format. This document defines the canonical structure for snapshots, issues, and related metadata.

## Overview

Specimens use:
- **YAML** for all configuration and issue definitions (`manifest.yaml` per snapshot, `critic_scopes.yaml`, issue files)
- **Git commits** for code snapshots (via VCS references - GitHub, git URLs, or local directories)

## Directory Structure

```
specimens/
├── critic_scopes.yaml          # Training example specifications
└── {project}/                  # Project-specific snapshots
    └── {slug}/                 # YYYY-MM-DD-NN format
        ├── manifest.yaml       # Snapshot metadata (source, split, bundle)
        ├── code/               # Source code (for vcs: local)
        └── issues/             # Issue files directory
            └── *.yaml          # Issue files (one per logical issue)
```

## manifest.yaml Schema

Each snapshot has its own `manifest.yaml` defining source, split, and optional bundle metadata.
The slug is derived from the directory path (e.g., `ducktape/2025-11-26-00`).

### Structure

```yaml
source:
  vcs: {github|git|local}       # Version control system type
  # Additional fields depend on vcs type
split: {train|valid|test}       # Dataset split assignment
bundle:                         # Optional historical metadata
  source_commit: {sha}          # Git commit SHA (40 hex chars)
  include:                      # Paths that were included
    - {path}/
  exclude:                      # Paths that were excluded (optional)
    - {path}/
```

### Source Types

**GitHub source** - fetches from GitHub tarball API:
```yaml
source:
  vcs: github
  org: agentydragon
  repo: ducktape
  ref: 4ad33013af27e159863bed92ffcfdb55b388e46c  # commit SHA or branch/tag
```

**Generic Git source** - clones from any git URL:
```yaml
source:
  vcs: git
  url: https://github.com/agentydragon/crush.git
  commit: a2a1ffa00943aa373f688ac05b667083ac3230b1
```

**Local source** - copies from a local directory:
```yaml
source:
  vcs: local
  root: code  # Path relative to snapshot directory (default: ".")
```

Use `vcs: local` with `root: code` when the source code is stored directly in the specimen (in a `code/` subdirectory).

### Examples

**Local source with bundle metadata** (`ducktape/2025-11-26-00/manifest.yaml`):
```yaml
source:
  vcs: local
  root: code
split: valid
bundle:
  source_commit: 751a2a33c8b7daaf18f6c004e31ed6485a62a6a9
  include:
    - adgn/
  exclude:
    - adgn/src/adgn/props/
```

**Git source** (`crush/2025-08-30-internal_db/manifest.yaml`):
```yaml
source:
  vcs: git
  url: https://github.com/agentydragon/crush.git
  commit: a2a1ffa00943aa373f688ac05b667083ac3230b1
split: train
```

**Minimal local source** (`gmail-archiver/2025-12-17-00/manifest.yaml`):
```yaml
source:
  vcs: local
  root: code
split: train
```

### Fields

- **`source`** (object, required): Defines where code comes from
- **`split`** (string, required): Dataset split assignment
  - `train`: Training data (full access to labels and execution traces)
  - `valid`: Validation data (can evaluate, but cannot read labels)
  - `test`: Test data (reserved for final holdout evaluation)
- **`bundle`** (object | null, optional): Historical metadata for provenance (not used at runtime)
  - `source_commit`: Full 40-character Git SHA that was captured
  - `include`: Subdirectories that were included during capture
  - `exclude`: Subdirectories that were excluded during capture

## critic_scopes.yaml Schema

Defines which file combinations to use as training examples for each snapshot.

### Structure

```yaml
{project}/{slug}:
  # Comment describing rationale for this grouping
  - files: [{file_path}, ...]

  # Another grouping
  - files: [{file_path}, ...]
```

### Example

```yaml
ducktape/2025-11-26-00:
  # Server initialization and lifecycle issues
  - files: [adgn/src/adgn/agent/server.py]

  # Approval hub logic and state management
  - files: [adgn/src/adgn/agent/approvals.py]

  # Check for duplicated type definitions across layers
  - files: [adgn/src/mcp/types.py, adgn/src/mcp/persist.py]

  # UI component patterns and style consistency
  - files: [adgn/src/agent/web/src/components/*.svelte]
```

### Fields

- **`files`** (list[string], required): File paths or glob patterns
  - Must match hydrated bundle structure (include `include` prefixes)
  - Supports glob patterns (`*.py`, `**/*.svelte`)

## Issue File Format (YAML)

Each `.yaml` file in the `issues/` directory defines a single issue (true positive or false positive).

### True Positive (should_flag: true)

Issues that should be caught by a critic.

```yaml
rationale: |
  Multi-line explanation of what's wrong and why.
  Describe the problem, its impact, and optionally the fix.

should_flag: true

occurrences:
  - occurrence_id: occ-0
    files:
      path/to/file.py:
        - [10, 20]        # Line range (inclusive)
        - [42, 42]        # Single line
    note: "Optional note for this occurrence"  # Required if multiple occurrences
    critic_scopes_expected_to_recall:
      - [path/to/file.py]  # File sets that should detect this
```

### False Positive (should_flag: false)

Patterns that look wrong but are actually acceptable.

```yaml
rationale: |
  Critics might flag [X] because [Y looks problematic].
  However, our ground truth is that it's acceptable because [Z].

should_flag: false

occurrences:
  - occurrence_id: occ-0
    files:
      path/to/file.py:
        - [10, 20]
    note: "Optional note"
    relevant_files:
      - path/to/file.py
```

### Line Range Formats

The `files` field maps file paths to line specifications. **Line specs must always be a list of `[start, end]` pairs.**

```yaml
files:
  # Single line - use [N, N]
  file_a.py:
    - [42, 42]

  # Single range
  file_b.py:
    - [10, 20]

  # Multiple ranges
  file_c.py:
    - [30, 40]
    - [50, 60]

  # Multiple single lines
  file_d.py:
    - [10, 10]
    - [25, 25]
    - [42, 42]
```

**Format rules:**

1. **Always use `list[[start, end], ...]` format** - no bare integers, no inline ranges:
   ```yaml
   # ❌ INVALID: bare integer
   file.py: 42

   # ❌ INVALID: inline range
   file.py: [10, 20]

   # ❌ INVALID: bare integers in list
   file.py:
     - 10
     - 20

   # ✅ CORRECT: list of [start, end] pairs
   file.py:
     - [42, 42]

   file.py:
     - [10, 20]
   ```

2. **Each range must have exactly 2 elements** `[start, end]`:
   ```yaml
   # ❌ INVALID: 1 element
   file.py:
     - [42]

   # ❌ INVALID: 3 elements
   file.py:
     - [10, 20, 30]

   # ✅ CORRECT: 2 elements per range
   file.py:
     - [10, 10]
     - [20, 20]
     - [30, 30]
   ```

3. **Single lines use `[N, N]`** (start equals end):
   ```yaml
   # Line 42 only
   file.py:
     - [42, 42]
   ```

All line numbers are 1-indexed (first line is 1, not 0). Ranges are inclusive on both ends.

### Auto-Inference Rules

**For true positives:**
- Single file in occurrence → `critic_scopes_expected_to_recall` auto-inferred as `[[that_file]]`
- Multiple files in occurrence → Must provide explicit `critic_scopes_expected_to_recall`
- Multiple occurrences → `note` field required on all occurrences

**For false positives:**
- `relevant_files` auto-inferred from keys of `files` if not provided

### Complete Examples

**True Positive (Single File, Single Occurrence):**
```yaml
rationale: |
  Lines 67-100 and 108-135 duplicate identical logic for computing AgentInfo.
  Fix: extract helper function.
should_flag: true
occurrences:
  - occurrence_id: occ-0
    files:
      adgn/src/adgn/agent/mcp_bridge/servers/registry_bridge.py:
        - [67, 100]
        - [108, 135]
    critic_scopes_expected_to_recall:
      - [adgn/src/adgn/agent/mcp_bridge/servers/registry_bridge.py]
```

**True Positive (Multiple Files, Multiple Occurrences):**
```yaml
rationale: |
  Three functions build lists imperatively using append() instead of comprehensions.
  Replace with list comprehensions for cleaner, more Pythonic code.
should_flag: true
occurrences:
  - occurrence_id: occ-0
    files:
      adgn/src/adgn/agent/mcp_bridge/servers/agents.py:
        - [50, 59]
      adgn/src/adgn/agent/mcp_bridge/servers/approvals_bridge.py:
        - [64, 65]
        - [71, 80]
    note: "In _convert_pending_approvals()"
    critic_scopes_expected_to_recall:
      - [adgn/src/adgn/agent/mcp_bridge/servers/agents.py]
      - [adgn/src/adgn/agent/mcp_bridge/servers/approvals_bridge.py]

  - occurrence_id: occ-1
    files:
      adgn/src/adgn/agent/server/runtime.py:
        - [267, 267]
        - [274, 274]
    note: "In runtime proposals building"
    critic_scopes_expected_to_recall:
      - [adgn/src/adgn/agent/server/runtime.py]
```

**False Positive:**
```yaml
rationale: |
  A past critique flagged the two reads surrounding the permission gate as an
  "unnecessary re-read". This is a false positive. The first read is a lightweight
  early equality check; the subsequent read populates oldContent for canonical
  diff/history recording. If permission.Request blocks, the file may change,
  so re-reading ensures recorded history reflects state at write time.
should_flag: false
occurrences:
  - occurrence_id: occ-0
    files:
      internal/llm/tools/write.go:
        - [148, 151]
        - [161, 167]
        - [174, 182]
    relevant_files:
      - internal/llm/tools/write.go
```

## Detection Standard (`critic_scopes_expected_to_recall`)

The key question for `critic_scopes_expected_to_recall`: **"If I gave a high-quality critic this file set to review, and they failed to find this issue, would that be a failure on their part?"**

### What "reviewing files" includes:
- Reading files thoroughly line by line
- Following imports and calls to check APIs
- Searching the codebase for existing helpers/patterns
- Looking for duplication or similar patterns
- All normal thorough code review activities

### What it does NOT mean:
- "Can you detect this reading ONLY these files in complete isolation?"
- "Without following any imports or doing any searches?"

### Semantics

`critic_scopes_expected_to_recall` is a list of alternative file sets (OR logic):
```yaml
critic_scopes_expected_to_recall:
  - [file_a.py]                  # Detectable from file_a alone
  - [file_b.py, file_c.py]       # OR detectable from both b AND c together
```

- **Outer list**: OR logic (any of these file sets works)
- **Inner list**: AND logic (all files in set required together)

### Examples

**Single-file issue:**
```yaml
# Unused import in server.py - obvious from the file itself
critic_scopes_expected_to_recall:
  - [src/server.py]
```

**Either-file issue (duplication):**
```yaml
# Enum duplicated in types.py and persist.py
# Seeing EITHER file should trigger "search for duplication"
critic_scopes_expected_to_recall:
  - [src/types.py]
  - [src/persist.py]
```

**Multi-file required (missing abstraction):**
```yaml
# Client duplicates logic that exists in utils
# Need to see both to notice the redundancy
critic_scopes_expected_to_recall:
  - [src/client.py, src/utils.py]
```

## Data Model (Python)

The YAML structures are validated by these Pydantic models:

### Issue (True Positive)

```python
class TruePositive(BaseModel):
    rationale: str              # 10-5000 characters
    should_flag: Literal[True]
    occurrences: list[TruePositiveOccurrence]

class TruePositiveOccurrence(BaseModel):
    occurrence_id: str
    files: dict[Path, list[LineRange] | None]
    note: str | None = None     # Required if multiple occurrences
    critic_scopes_expected_to_recall: set[frozenset[Path]]

class LineRange(BaseModel):
    start_line: int             # 1-based, >= 1
    end_line: int | None        # 1-based, inclusive, None for single line
```

### FalsePositive

```python
class FalsePositive(BaseModel):
    rationale: str              # 10-5000 characters
    should_flag: Literal[False]
    occurrences: list[FalsePositiveOccurrence]

class FalsePositiveOccurrence(BaseModel):
    occurrence_id: str
    files: dict[Path, list[LineRange] | None]
    note: str | None = None     # Required if multiple occurrences
    relevant_files: set[Path]
```

## Validation Rules

### Snapshot Slugs
- Format: `{project}/{YYYY-MM-DD-NN}`
- Date is snapshot creation date
- NN is zero-padded sequence number for that day (00, 01, ...)

### File Paths
- Must match hydrated bundle structure exactly
- Include `include` prefixes from `snapshots.yaml`
- Use forward slashes (Unix-style paths)

### Line Ranges
- Always use `list[[start, end], ...]` format
- 1-indexed (first line is 1, not 0)
- Inclusive on both ends: `[10, 20]` means lines 10-20
- Single line: `[10, 10]` (no bare integers)

### Rationale
- Must be 10-5000 characters (after whitespace stripping)
- Use `|` for multi-line YAML strings

### critic_scopes_expected_to_recall
- Each inner list must be a subset of files mentioned in `files` (for that occurrence)
- Cannot be empty list
- At least one alternative file set must be provided

### Multi-occurrence Issues
- All occurrences MUST have `note` field when there are multiple occurrences
- If total unique files across ALL occurrences > 1, EVERY occurrence must have explicit `critic_scopes_expected_to_recall`

## File Naming

Issue files use descriptive slugs (lowercase with hyphens), not numerical indices:
- ✅ Good: `dead-code.yaml`, `missing-types.yaml`, `duplicate-logic.yaml`
- ❌ Bad: `issue-001.yaml`, `iss-032.yaml`

**Prefer shorter names when meaning is preserved.** Verbose names add noise without value.

@canonical-slugs.md

**General examples:**
- ✅ `swallowed-exceptions.yaml` not `ui-swallowed-exceptions.yaml`
- ✅ `unused-params.yaml` not `unused-function-parameters.yaml`

Slugs should be 0-30 characters and convey the issue type.

## YAML Style

- Use `|` for multi-line rationale strings
- Line ranges: always `list[[start, end], ...]` format, single lines as `[N, N]`
- Minimal comments: prefer structured fields over comments
