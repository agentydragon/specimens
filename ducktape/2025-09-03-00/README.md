# Specimen

## TODO: Automated analysis

- [x] llm/adgn_llm/src/adgn_llm/git_commit_ai/**/*.py — run open-ended review; include uncovered issues
- [x] llm/adgn_llm/src/adgn_llm/mini_codex/**/*.py — run open-ended review; include uncovered issues
- [x] llm/adgn_llm/src/adgn_llm/mcp/docker_exec/**/*.py — run open-ended review; include uncovered issues
- [x] llm/adgn_llm/src/adgn_llm/mcp/sandboxed_jupyter_mcp/**/*.py — run open-ended review; include uncovered issues
- [x] Aggregate all section outputs into unconfirmed.md

## TODO: Follow-ups

- [ ] git_commit_ai/cli.py:L497 — Likely false positive; confirm and either document the exception pattern or add a clarifying property.
  GAP: Define conditions distinguishing acceptable patterns from swallowers; update specimen once decided.

- [ ] URL construction style and deduplication
  - Multiple places assemble `http://127.0.0.1:{port}` for document/runtime URLs:
    - llm/adgn_llm/src/adgn_llm/mcp/sandboxed_jupyter_mcp/wrapper.py:303, 391, 397
    - llm/adgn_llm/src/adgn_llm/mcp/sandboxed_jupyter_mcp/jupyter_mcp_launch.py:138, 157, 163
  - Decision pending:
    - Whether to enforce urllib.parse builders vs f-strings for these trivial local URLs
    - How/where to deduplicate base URL construction (single helper vs localized consolidation)
  - Regardless of library choice, dedupe the base URL construction.
