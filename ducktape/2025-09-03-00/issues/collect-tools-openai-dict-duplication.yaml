  _collect_tools_live has duplicated logic for building openai_tools dict entries.
  The stdio branch (lines 121-128) and local branch (lines 133-140) create identical
  dict structures with "type", "name", "description", "parameters" keys. Should extract
  a helper function that takes (server, tool_name, description, params_schema) and
  returns the tool dict, then call it from both branches. This would eliminate 8 lines
  of duplication and make the tool dict structure easier to maintain.
