rationale: |
  The PTY reader uses two loops (a poll loop until task.done() and a final drain loop). Since the
  drain loop already consumes remaining data until EOF/error, a single `while True` drain with
  clear exit conditions suffices and simplifies control flow.

  Suggestion: replace the poll+drain pair with one loop that reads, writes to the aggregator, and breaks
  on EOF/exception. Add a brief comment documenting the exit conditions.
