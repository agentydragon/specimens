rationale: |
  `AppConfig.resolve` constructs `model_str` and also stores `provider` and `model_name` split from it, but
  later code reads the composite `model_str` only for logging/printing. Since `model_str` is trivially derivable
  as `f"{provider}:{model_name}"`, avoid storing this redundant field and derive it where needed.

  This reduces duplicated state and keeps the config focused on primary fields.
