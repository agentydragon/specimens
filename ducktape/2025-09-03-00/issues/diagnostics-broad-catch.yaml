rationale: |
  During diagnostics the code catches broad Exception, prints a diagnostic message, and continues. In a
  diagnostics path
  this masks failures that were supposed to surface useful debug information — the wrapper should fail fast or
  at least
  propagate the error after logging full context.

  Diagnostics code should make problems visible and actionable. Silently continuing after printing a short
  message
  prevents test harnesses and callers from noticing failures and makes root-cause debugging much harder.

  Prefer: log full traceback and re-raise (or exit non-zero) so CI/tests detect the issue. Only suppress known,
  explicitly
  documented non-fatal exceptions.
