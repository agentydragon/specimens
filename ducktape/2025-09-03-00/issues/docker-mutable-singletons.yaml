rationale: |
  Module-level `_DOCKER_CLIENT` and `_CONTAINER_REF` introduce mutable global state that couples requests
  through hidden, process-wide singletons. This makes behavior order-dependent, complicates testing,
  and risks leaking configuration across calls.

  Prefer explicit dependency injection: pass a Docker client via parameters or a factory, or manage per-request
  context that resolves the container ref at call time. Keep state local to the request boundary.
