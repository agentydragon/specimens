  Line 67 has an unnecessarily complex pattern where shlex.quote is applied separately to cmd and each arg:
    " ".join([shlex.quote(cmd), *[shlex.quote(a) for a in args_list]])

  This mixes a list literal containing one quoted item with a spread of a list comprehension that quotes each
  arg. The
  duplication of shlex.quote across the two contexts is awkward and harder to read than the unified form:
    " ".join(shlex.quote(x) for x in [cmd, *args_list])

  The unified form applies shlex.quote uniformly to all items (cmd and args) in a single comprehension, making
  the
  quoting
  logic clear and consistent.
