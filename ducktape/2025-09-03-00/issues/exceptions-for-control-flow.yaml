  Do not use try/except to detect normal, non-error conditions. Reserve exceptions for unexpected situations.
  The current "first commit" detection relies on catching a diff failure, which can also swallow unrelated
  errors.
  Prefer a positive repository capability/condition check with early bailout. Example pattern:
    - If we're in the 90% normal case (without executing a failing operation), run the normal path.
    - Else, handle the 10% case explicitly.
  As a reviewer, seeing try/except signals "what's on fire" (unexpected), not a routine precondition check.
