rationale: |
  The call site constructs a tiny literal object only to pass it to write_text; prefer inlining the single-line
  construction at the call site for concision and to avoid one-off temporary names.

  Example: replace
    kernelspec = {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python"}
    (ks_dir / "kernel.json").write_text(json.dumps(kernelspec))
  with
    (ks_dir / "kernel.json").write_text(json.dumps({"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3", "language":
    "python"}))

  This reduces lines and the mental map of short-lived temporaries without harming readability for small literal
  payloads.
