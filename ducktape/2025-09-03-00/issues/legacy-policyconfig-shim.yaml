rationale: |
  The wrapper contains a legacy PolicyConfig shim that exists only for import compatibility with older tests.
  Keeping dead shims because "tests still reference it" is not a sufficient reason to retain the code: tests
  should be
  updated to the canonical model or provided a test-only shim.

  Why this is bad:
  - It preserves dead/unused code paths that increase maintenance burden and cognitive load.
  - New readers assume the shim is live behavior and may write code to support it, increasing cruft.
  - Tests depending on obsolete shims should be migrated or wrapped in explicit test fixtures rather than
  perpetuating
  legacy surface area.
