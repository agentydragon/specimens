rationale: |
  McpManager.call_tool() has asymmetric calling conventions: stdio tools are awaited (L273),
  but local handlers are called synchronously (L280). This means local tools doing
  time.sleep(10) would block the event loop, while "sleep 10" in a stdio tool would not.
  Either local handlers should support async (call with await if coroutine detected), or
  the assymetry should at least be documented.
