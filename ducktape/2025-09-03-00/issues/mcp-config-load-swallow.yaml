rationale: |
  The code currently conditionally reads an MCP config only if the file exists. That’s fine. The problem is the
  broad
  except that silently ignores *errors parsing or using the file*. If the .mcp.json exists but is malformed or
  otherwise
  unusable, the program must crash loudly so operator/CI notices and fixes the problem; do NOT silently ignore a
  present-but-broken config file.

  Swallowing initialization-time parsing/shape errors leads to silently degraded runtime behavior and
  hard-to-diagnose
  failures later. If the file exists, treat errors parsing/using it as fatal.
