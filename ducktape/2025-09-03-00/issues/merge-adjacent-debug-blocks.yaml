  Two adjacent `if known.debug:` blocks perform closely related logging/setup:

    if known.debug:
      print(f"# Resolved model=..., timeout=...", file=sys.stderr)

    if known.debug:
      console_handler = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stderr)
      ...

  Combine them into a single `if known.debug:` to reduce duplicated conditionals,
  group related debug behavior together, and simplify control flow.
