rationale: |
  The code swallows all exceptions from model_dump and continues:

    try:
      prior_tool_calls.append(item.model_dump(exclude_none=True))
    except Exception:
      pass

  This hides serialization bugs and corrupts the transcript/tool-call history.
  Do not catch exceptions here; let them surface and fail loudly. If there were
  a specific, expected error, catch it narrowly with context and re-raise — but
  in this location the correct fix is to remove the try/except entirely.
