  Lines 70-76 construct a `StdioServerParameters` object spread across multiple lines:
    self._stdio_cm = stdio_client(
        StdioServerParameters(
            command=shell,
            args=args_for_shell,
            env=env,
        ),
    )

  This construction has only three simple keyword arguments (command, args, env), all of which are short
  variable names.
  Breaking it across multiple lines adds vertical space without improving readability - the call fits
  comfortably on one
  line.

  Prefer the single-line form:
    self._stdio_cm = stdio_client(StdioServerParameters(command=shell, args=args_for_shell, env=env))

  This reduces vertical clutter and keeps the initialization concise. Reserve multi-line formatting for calls
  with many
  arguments, long expressions, or complex nested structures where breaking across lines genuinely aids
  comprehension.
