  The contract of --output-last-message is that the final output exists only in the designated file.
  Falling back to stdout silently violates that contract and can mask real errors.
  More importantly, codex is a TUI app: stdout contains box-drawing and UI noise, so substituting it yields
  random
  terminal detritus instead of the model’s final message — and it happens silently with a zero exit code.
  Prefer to fail loudly (or request a new run) if the last message file cannot be read.
