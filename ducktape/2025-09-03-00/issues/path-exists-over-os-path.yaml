rationale: |
  Use pathlib.Path methods when operating on filesystem paths. Replace `os.path.exists(path)` with
  `Path(path).exists()`
  so the code consistently treats paths as Path-like objects and avoids mixing abstractions.

  Benefits:
  - Consistent use of Path improves readability and makes subsequent Path operations (open(), joinpath(),
  etc.) natural without extra conversions.
  - Avoids subtle differences between os.path handling and Path semantics across platforms.

  In this specimen the MCP config loader uses `os.path.exists(path)`; prefer `Path(path).exists()` (or accept a
  Path at
  the API boundary) to tighten the contract.
