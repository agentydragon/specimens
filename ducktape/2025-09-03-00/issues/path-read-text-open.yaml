rationale: |
  For simple file I/O, prefer using Path.read_text()/Path.write_text() or Path.open() instead of calling
  open(str(path),
  ...) manually.

  Benefits:
  - Concise one-liners for common patterns.
  - Keeps types as Path objects and avoids repeated str() conversions.
  - Clearer intent and small performance/readability improvements.
