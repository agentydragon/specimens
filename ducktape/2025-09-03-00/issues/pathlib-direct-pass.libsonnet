    Many stdlib and library APIs accept os.PathLike objects (pathlib.Path). Prefer passing Path objects directly instead of calling str(path) everywhere.

    Why this matters:
    - Stripping Path -> str casts reduces noise and one-off conversions.
    - Passing Path preserves richer semantics (e.g., platform-specific paths, pathlike wrappers) and is less error-prone.
    - Modern APIs (subprocess, os.open, many stdlib functions) accept Path objects and will do the correct conversion; explicit str() casts are unnecessary.
