rationale: |
  The OpenAI SDK already reads `OPENAI_API_KEY` and base URL env vars; hand-rolling a client factory that
  fetches
  env vars duplicates configuration paths and adds code surface without value.

  Prefer:
  - Call `openai.OpenAI()` directly and let the SDK read environment variables; or
  - Inject a client (DI) from the caller/tests to keep construction policy out of core logic.

  This reduces duplication and makes tests simpler (just pass a client/fake).
