rationale: |
  Modules under packages that are executed via console_scripts should not carry a `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
  shebang or be executable; the packaging shim handles invocation. Keeping shebangs on importable modules
  is misleading and unnecessary. Remove the shebang from library modules; reserve shebangs for true scripts
  under bin/ (if any).
