rationale: |
  The `if args.command == "stdio"` branch nests the entire stdio handling flow under an if-block, pushing the
  main
  (long)
  path inside an indented branch.

  Prefer an early-bailout/inverted form that returns or delegates early when the condition isn't met, so the
  main path
  is
  at the base indentation level. This makes long flows easier to read, reduces cognitive load from deep nesting,
  and
  shortens diffs when adding or removing steps in the happy path.

  Example: instead of
    if args.command == "stdio":
        # long stdio flow
    else:
        return other_path()
  Prefer
    if args.command != "stdio":
        return other_path()
    # long stdio flow (base indentation)

  Benefits: flatter control flow, clearer happy path, fewer indentation-driven mistakes.
