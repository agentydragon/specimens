    The timeout branch is a literal no-op:

      if timed_out:
        # We cannot reliably kill the exec unless wrapper handled it; return best-effort
        pass

    Timeout handling in this module:
    - With USE_CONTAINER_TIMEOUT_WRAPPER=1, commands are wrapped in `timeout -s TERM <secs>` inside the container (see lines 27–31), so the process is actually signaled on expiry.
    - Without the wrapper, we stop reading and return ExecResult with `timed_out=True`, but the container process may keep running. Tests only assert `timed_out`; they do not verify termination.

    This is a footgun: timeouts can exceed and leave processes running. At the very least, document this behavior prominently and surface explicit return markers (e.g., `timeout_enforced=false` or `kill_attempted=false`) so callers can react.

    Preferred fix: require an always-correct timeout path. If a timeout is requested and the wrapper is unavailable, fail fast (refuse to run) instead of best-effort; or ensure the implementation enforces termination reliably. Delete the empty branch.
