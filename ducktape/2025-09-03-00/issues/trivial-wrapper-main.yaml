rationale: |
  The CLI `main()` in `mcp/sandboxed_jupyter_mcp/cli.py` merely delegates to `wrapper.main()` without adding any
  value
  (no
  argument transformation, validation, or help text).
  One-line passthrough wrappers like this add indirection and lines of code for no benefit. Prefer calling the
  implementation directly from entry points or consolidating the tiny delegating main into the wrapper to reduce
  churn
  and
  improve readability.
