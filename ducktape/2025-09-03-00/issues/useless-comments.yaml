rationale: |
  Comments that add no value: obvious narration, historical notes, or trivial restatements
  of what code already shows. Good comments explain non-obvious decisions; these should
  be deleted.

  **Four categories of useless comments in cli.py:**

  **1. Historical/archaeology comment (line 873)**
  "Factor out task creation to a single place" - carries historical intent rather than
  present-tense information. The refactoring already happened; comment is archaeology.

  **2. Trivial narration comments (lines 772, 686-687, 694-695)**
  Three comments that merely restate the next line without adding context:
  - "Detect --amend flag" → next line checks for --amend
  - "Build status string" → next line constructs status string
  - "Print the status" → next line prints output

  The code itself is self-explanatory. Narration comments add noise without information.

  **Correct approach:**

  Delete comments that:
  - Restate what code/naming already shows
  - Carry historical intent (use git history)
  - Are trivial narration of next line
