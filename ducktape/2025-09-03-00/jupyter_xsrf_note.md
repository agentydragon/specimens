# Note: Jupyter MCP XSRF behavior

Summary
- The sandboxed Jupyter server used by the MCP disables XSRF (c.ServerApp.disable_check_xsrf = True) while supplying a token and binding to 127.0.0.1. This weakens protections even with a token. We keep this as a tracked note because the Jupyter MCP we use may not support XSRF (needs verification).

Rationale / current stance
- GitHub MCP/Jupyter runtime is local-only with token auth, but disabling XSRF reduces defense-in-depth. We will not flag this as a violation right now due to possible MCP server limitations, but we should revisit.

Action items
- Verify whether the Jupyter MCP and its downstream clients support XSRF properly. If supported, remove all disable_check_xsrf settings and rely on token+XSRF.
- Keep token required, bind to 127.0.0.1, and keep password empty only with token present.
- If XSRF must remain disabled for technical reasons, document the constraint clearly and gate behind a dev/test flag.
