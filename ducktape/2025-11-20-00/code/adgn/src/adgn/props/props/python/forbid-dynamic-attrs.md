title: Forbid dynamic attribute access and catching AttributeError
kind: outcome
---

Code does not use the `getattr`, `hasattr`, or `setattr` builtins, and does not catch `AttributeError`.
Code assumes variables have specific known types/type-sets (constrained by type annotations, `isinstance` checks, guarantees on return values etc.) and having attributes those types imply.
Code does not treat objects as effectively-`dict[str, Any]`.

## Acceptance criteria (checklist)
- No usage of `getattr`, `hasattr`, or `setattr`; LITERALLY FORBIDDEN whenever direct attribute access would be runtime-equivalent (i.e., the type is known or constrained).
- No `except AttributeError` (including in multi-except or bare except that later filters to AttributeError), and no code paths that swallow missing attributes and continue silently
- Attribute access is type-safe by design (static types or explicit data structures)
- Code does not "guess" attributes by trying multiple names via `getattr`/`hasattr`
- Code that legitimately branches by multiple possible input types uses `isinstance`, `match..case` or other explicit constructs - not `getattr`/`hasattr`/`setattr`.
- Trivial guards do not swallow missing attributes; they fail fast instead of continuing silently

## Positive examples
```python
# Type-driven design: explicit attributes
class User:  # could be a dataclass/attrs/TypedDict as well
    def __init__(self, name: str, email: str):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email

u = User("Rai", "rai@example.com")
send(u.email)
```


## Exceptions (rare, deliberate)

- Only when names truly arrive dynamically (e.g., plugin entrypoints specified as "package.module:function"), and only at explicit boundaries; prefer a registry/mapping over attribute probing. If used, keep scope narrow and document why direct access is impossible.
- Never use dynamic attribute probing to guess between multiple names; design types to make invalid states unrepresentable.

## Negative examples
```python
# Dynamic probing — forbidden
if hasattr(obj, "email"):
    send(getattr(obj, "email"))
```

```python
# Dynamic assignment — forbidden
setattr(config, "timeout", 10)
```

```python
# Hiding type errors behind exception catching — forbidden
try:
    return obj.value
except AttributeError:
    return None
```

```python
# Obscuring types and swallowing errors — forbidden
# house: House (pydantic) with attributes: roof: Roof, door: Door, num_windows: int
if hasattr(house, "roof"):
    # Tries to guess attributes and continues even if structure is wrong
    print("house has", getattr(getattr(house, "roof", None), "material", None))
```

```python
# Guessing multiple attribute spellings — forbidden
if hasattr(item, "id") or hasattr(item, "identifier") or hasattr(item, "ID"):
    ident = getattr(item, "id", None) or getattr(item, "identifier", None) or getattr(item, "ID", None)
    use(ident)
```
