rationale: |
  MCP abort_agent tool calls agent.abort() method that doesn't exist on MiniCodex.

  The abort_agent tool at agents.py:656 calls:
  await local_runtime.agent.abort()  # type: ignore[attr-defined]  # TODO: Implement abort() on MiniCodex

  The type ignore and TODO comment explicitly acknowledge the method is missing.

  Impact:
  - Calling abort_agent MCP tool raises AttributeError at runtime
  - Tool is unusable despite being exposed to agents/users

  The MiniCodex class only has abort_pending_tool_calls() which synthesizes
  error results for pending tool calls but doesn't provide a full abort() method.

  Fix: Implement abort() method on MiniCodex or remove the broken tool.
