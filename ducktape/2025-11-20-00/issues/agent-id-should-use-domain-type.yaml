  Agent.id (models.py:70) uses Mapped[str], but code wraps with AgentID() at
  runtime (sqlite.py:131,147). If SQLAlchemy supports NewType, should declare
  as AgentID to eliminate runtime wrappers.

  Using domain types provides:
  - Type safety: can't mix different ID types
  - Semantic clarity: not just any string, but specific identifier
  - No runtime conversions/validation
  - Clear type contracts in signatures
