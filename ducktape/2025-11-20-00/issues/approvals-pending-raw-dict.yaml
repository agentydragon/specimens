  approvals_pending_global builds approval_data as a raw dict and serializes it with json.dumps().
  Structured data should be handled in Pydantic models - either extend PendingApproval to include
  agent_id, or create a dedicated model for the global mailbox items. This provides validation,
  type safety, and consistent serialization.
