  approvals_pending_global builds URIs and JSON by accessing approval.call_id, approval.tool,
  and approval.args, but PendingApproval only exposes tool_call (a ToolCall object) and timestamp.
  The code raises AttributeError on every invocation because these attributes don't exist at the
  PendingApproval level - they need to be accessed via approval.tool_call.call_id,
  approval.tool_call.name, and approval.tool_call.args_json respectively.
