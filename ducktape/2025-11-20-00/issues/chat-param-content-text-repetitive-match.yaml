  chat_param_message_content_as_text (lines 75-105) has repetitive match cases with nearly
  identical logic for each role. Instead of handling each role separately (ASSISTANT, USER,
  SYSTEM, TOOL/FUNCTION/DEVELOPER) with duplicated content-parsing code, it could have a single
  upfront check that the role is in a list of understood roles (fail-fast if not), then apply
  the same content-parsing logic for all cases.
