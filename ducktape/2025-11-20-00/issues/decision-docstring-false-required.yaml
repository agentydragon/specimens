rationale: |
  The Decision class docstring claims "All fields are REQUIRED", but the reason field is
  str | None = None (optional). The docstring should be simplified to just the first line:
  "Decision made about a tool call." The statement about required fields is misleading and
  the note about Decision being optional on ToolCallRecord is redundant with the type
  annotation on ToolCallRecord itself.
