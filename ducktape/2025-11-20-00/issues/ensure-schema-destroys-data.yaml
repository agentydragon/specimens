rationale: |
  The `ensure_schema` method unconditionally drops ALL tables before recreating them,
  destroying all persisted data on every call. The function name suggests safe,
  idempotent behavior (ensuring schema exists), but the implementation calls
  `Base.metadata.drop_all()` followed by `create_all()`.

  This causes complete data loss on every application restart. Production call sites
  in app.py:176 and cli.py:124 invoke this during startup, wiping agents, runs,
  events, policies, and tool calls each time the server starts.

  SQLAlchemy's `create_all()` is already idempotent—it only creates missing tables.
  The `drop_all()` call serves no purpose except data destruction.
