rationale: |
  Run model stores event_count: Mapped[int] (models.py:65) that duplicates information
  already available from the events relationship.

  event_count is manually incremented on every event insert (sqlite.py:389):
  update(Run).where(Run.id == str(run_id)).values(event_count=Run.event_count + 1)

  This is:
  - Redundant: count is derivable from len(run.events) or COUNT query
  - Error-prone: risks desync if increments are missed or duplicated
  - Additional write overhead on every event

  Should remove event_count field and compute when needed:
  - For queries: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events WHERE run_id = ?
  - For loaded objects: len(run.events)
  - For aggregation: Use SQLAlchemy func.count()

  Storage denormalization only justified for performance-critical paths, not evident here.
