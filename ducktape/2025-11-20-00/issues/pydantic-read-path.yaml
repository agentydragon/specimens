rationale: |
  Building intermediate dict before constructing Pydantic model at read boundary.

  Code creates row_dict from SQLAlchemy result (lines 445-454), then passes to
  parse_event. This intermediate dict step is unnecessary and loses type safety.

  Should construct EventRecord directly with keyword arguments for immediate field
  validation and type checking.

  Anti-pattern: dict as intermediate representation when going from DB row to
  typed model. Correct approach: pass SQLAlchemy row fields directly to Pydantic
  constructor using keyword arguments.

  Benefits:
  - Type safety: catch field mismatches at type-check time
  - No intermediate dict allocation
  - Immediate validation on construction
  - Clearer data flow
