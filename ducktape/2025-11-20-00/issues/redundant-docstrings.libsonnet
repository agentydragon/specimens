// Docstrings duplicate information already present in type system

I.issueMulti(
  rationale=|||
    Docstrings duplicate information already present in type system, creating
    maintenance burden without adding information.

    Problems with redundant docstrings:
    - Create desync risk when types change
    - Duplicate maintenance (must update multiple locations)
    - Violate DRY principle
    - Add no information beyond type definitions

    Correct approach: Document types at their definition sites. Functions/models
    using those types should reference the type name, not duplicate its documentation.
