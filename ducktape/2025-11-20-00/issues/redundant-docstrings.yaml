  Docstrings duplicate information already present in type system, creating
  maintenance burden without adding information.

  Problems with redundant docstrings:
  - Create desync risk when types change
  - Duplicate maintenance (must update multiple locations)
  - Violate DRY principle
  - Add no information beyond type definitions

  Correct approach: Document types at their definition sites. Functions/models
  using those types should reference the type name, not duplicate its documentation.
