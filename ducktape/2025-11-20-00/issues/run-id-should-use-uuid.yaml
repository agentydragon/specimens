  Run.id (models.py:57) uses Mapped[str] in model, but domain code uses UUID.
  Creates constant str(run_id) conversions (sqlite.py:378,389). SQLAlchemy
  supports UUID types that handle serialization automatically.

  Using domain types provides:
  - Type safety: can't mix different ID types
  - Semantic clarity: not just any string, but specific identifier
  - No runtime conversions/validation
  - Clear type contracts in signatures
