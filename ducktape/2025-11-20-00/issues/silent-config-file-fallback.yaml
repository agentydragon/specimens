rationale: |
  When user provides explicit config file flags (--mcp-config or --initial-policy) with
  non-existent file paths, the code silently falls back without error messages.

  Pattern (applies to both flags):
  - Check if file exists
  - If not: use fallback value (empty config or None)
  - Server starts successfully
  - User doesn't know their config wasn't loaded

  This is problematic because:
  - User explicitly specified config file (not optional/auto-detected)
  - Non-existence likely indicates user error (typo, wrong directory, deleted file)
  - Silent fallback masks the problem
  - User discovers issue later when expected configuration is missing

  Correct behavior (per user):
  Option 1: Remove exists() check, let FileNotFoundError propagate naturally
  Option 2: Explicitly check and report: raise click.UsageError(f"Config file not found: {path}")

  Both approaches fail fast at startup with clear feedback, rather than starting in wrong state.
