rationale: |
  AgentSession._run_impl builds and sends a snapshot before setting self.active_run. Line 399
  calls `await self._manager.send_payload(await self.build_snapshot())` but self.active_run isn't
  assigned until line 400-402. Since build_snapshot only includes run metadata when
  self.active_run is non-None, the startup snapshot always contains active_run_id=None, empty
  pending_approvals, and no SnapshotDetails. UI clients reading the snapshot resource never learn
  that a run started until the next snapshot emission (typically at run completion). The
  active_run assignment should be moved before the build_snapshot call so the snapshot accurately
  reflects that a run is active.
