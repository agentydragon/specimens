  File imports sqlalchemy.event inside __init__ method (sqlite.py:53), immediately
  before using it to register event listener.

  Current (lines 53-56):
  from sqlalchemy import event

  @event.listens_for(self.engine.sync_engine, "connect")
  def enable_foreign_keys(dbapi_conn, connection_record):
      ...

  This violates PEP 8 guideline that imports should be at module top.

  Should move to top-level imports with other sqlalchemy imports.

  Reasons for top-level imports:
  - Standard Python convention (PEP 8)
  - Easier to see all module dependencies at a glance
  - No performance benefit to lazy import (module already imported elsewhere)
  - Simpler: no need to remember which imports are inline vs top

  Only valid reasons for inline imports:
  - Circular import resolution
  - Optional dependency (with try/except)
  - Heavy module only used in rare code path

  None of these apply here - sqlalchemy is already imported at top of file.
