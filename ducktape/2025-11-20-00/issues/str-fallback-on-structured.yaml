  chat_param_message_content_as_text (lines 75-105) claims to "extract text content", but when
  content is not a plain string (e.g., multi-part ChatCompletion*MessageParam with structured
  content like [{'type': 'text', 'text': 'hi'}]), it falls back to str(content) (lines 85, 92,
  99, 104), returning the Python repr of the structure instead of the actual text. This is
  misleading and makes it easy to abuse the API - callers receive strings like "[{'type':
  'text', 'text': 'hi'}]" and may not realize they're getting repr output rather than extracted
  text. The function should be designed to make abuse hard: it should expect text-only content
  and either raise an exception or return None (with a return type like str | None) when called
  on non-text content, forcing callers to handle structured content explicitly. The name and
  docstring should also clarify that this is only for text-only messages.
