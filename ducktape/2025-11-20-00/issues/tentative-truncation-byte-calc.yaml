  `_truncate_text` (line 132) reports truncated bytes as
  `len(s.encode('utf-8')) - len(raw)`. At this point `s` was just decoded from
  `raw` (line 131), so re-encoding it produces nearly the same byte count —
  the difference is at most a few bytes from `errors="replace"` substituting
  broken trailing bytes with U+FFFD. The message always says something like
  "truncated (+0 bytes)" or "+3 bytes" instead of the actual amount removed.
  The original byte length should be captured before truncation.
