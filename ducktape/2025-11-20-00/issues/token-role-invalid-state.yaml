  TokenRole + agent_id (mcp_routing.py:76-97) accepts role and agent_id
  separately, allowing invalid state (AGENT role without agent_id). Should
  use discriminated union (HumanTokenInfo | AgentTokenInfo) to make invalid
  state unrepresentable.

  Current code has runtime check `if not agent_id` at line 86 to handle
  the invalid state that the type system allows.

  Using discriminated union provides:
  - Type safety: invalid states unrepresentable
  - No runtime validation needed
  - Clear type contracts in signatures
