rationale: |
  The --ui-port flag is defined and accepted but misleads users about a non-existent Management UI.

  In single-agent mode: the flag is completely unused (no UI app created).
  In multi-agent mode: the flag binds a stub FastAPI app with unimplemented features:
  - WebSocket at /ws/mcp returns "not_implemented" (server.py:287-289)
  - No web frontend exists (no HTML/JS/Svelte files for "Management UI")

  Log messages compound the problem:
  - "Management UI: http://{host}:{ui_port}" - suggests functional UI (doesn't exist)
  - "MCP: ws://{host}:{ui_port}/ws/mcp" - suggests working WebSocket (unimplemented)

  The flag's only functional use is binding uvicorn (cli.py:166), but the server serves
  nothing beyond stubs and proxies. This creates unnecessary complexity (two ports instead
  of one) and false expectations about Management UI capabilities.

  Fix: Remove --ui-port flag. Either implement the promised UI or consolidate all endpoints
  onto mcp-port.
