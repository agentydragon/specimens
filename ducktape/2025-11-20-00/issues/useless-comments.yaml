  Comment states what break statement obviously does: "Break sender loop - connection
  is broken". The break is inside an exception handler after logging "WebSocket send
  failed", so context is already clear.

  Comments should explain why, not what. This comment adds no information beyond what's
  visible in the control flow and surrounding code.
