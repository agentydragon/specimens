  Line 622 creates the runtime container with `ephemeral=True`, but line 629
  stores `self.runtime_ephemeral = False`. The comment on 628 says "Persist
  runtime ephemerality for status reporting (explicit)" — the value contradicts
  both the comment's intent and the actual container configuration. Status
  reports will incorrectly show the runtime as non-ephemeral.
