rationale: |
  _load_yaml coerces any falsy YAML payload to {} before the type check (line 35:
  `data = yaml.safe_load(f) or {}`). This means non-mapping presets like [], 0, false, or None
  are silently treated as empty mappings, bypassing the isinstance(data, dict) check on line 36
  that should raise "preset must be a mapping". The `or {}` should be removed - let yaml.safe_load
  return whatever it returns, and let the isinstance check fail naturally for non-dict values.
  This hides malformed presets and causes downstream validation errors instead of clear early
  failures.
