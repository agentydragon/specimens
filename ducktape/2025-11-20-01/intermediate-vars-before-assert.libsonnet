    Lines 89-94, 96-101, 113-116, 124-132 extract list values into intermediate variables
    (fc1, fco1, fc2, fco2) and immediately use them once in assertions. These single-use
    variables should be inlined directly into the assert_that() calls.

    Variables used exactly once add no semantic clarity and make tests longer. Standard
    pattern: only extract when used multiple times or when the variable name clarifies
    a complex expression. Here fc1/fco1 names don't clarify turn2_input[ri1_idx + 1].

    Note: Lines 19-32 fc1/fc2 definitions are fine - they're used in response sequence
    construction, not single-use assertions.
