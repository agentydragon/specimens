    Repeated admin_server creation should be a shared fixture.

    Every test creates its own `ApprovalPolicyAdminServer(engine=engine)`. This appears at lines 43, 56, 70, 90, 107, 122, 133, 146.

    Should be a fixture that depends on the `engine` fixture.

    Benefits:
    - DRY principle
    - Consistent setup across tests
    - Easy to modify server configuration
