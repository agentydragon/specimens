  Repeated admin_server creation should be a shared fixture.

  Every test creates its own `ApprovalPolicyAdminServer(engine=engine)`. This appears at lines 43, 56, 70, 90,
  107, 122,
  133, 146.

  Should be a fixture that depends on the `engine` fixture.

  Benefits:
  - DRY principle
  - Consistent setup across tests
  - Easy to modify server configuration
