  Lines 136-147: Complex 12-line assertion with nested loops, boolean flag,
  and break statements should be replaced with declarative hamcrest matcher.

  **What it checks:**
  captured[-1].input contains a UserMessage with content containing InputTextPart
  where text includes "<system notification>".

  **Current approach:** Imperative loops with mutable found flag, manual
  isinstance checks, nested breaks.

  **Should use:** Hamcrest matchers like has_properties, instance_of, and
  contains_string to express the same check declaratively.
