  Lines 62-93 define _coerce_error_data that tries to coerce various error representations
  to mtypes.ErrorData with extensive defensive fallbacks. Lines 56-60 define a Protocol
  for attribute-based fallback. This overly defensive function should be deleted entirely.

  Problems: swallows validation errors and tries manual construction (lines 75-85), has
  attribute-based fallback for objects with .code/.message (lines 87-92), mixes validation
  with data extraction, violates fail-fast principle, makes debugging harder.

  Delete _coerce_error_data and _ErrorFields Protocol. Replace three usage sites (lines
  116, 119, 122) with direct mtypes.ErrorData.model_validate() calls. If data doesn't
  match schema, Pydantic raises clear validation errors instead of silently constructing
  minimal ErrorData or returning None.
