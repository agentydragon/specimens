rationale: |
  The `get_json_schema` helper function (lines 183-186) has exactly one call site and should
  be inlined and deleted.

  **Current code:**
  ```python
  def get_json_schema(model: type) -> dict[str, Any]:
      """Get JSON Schema for a Pydantic model."""
      adapter = TypeAdapter(model)
      return adapter.json_schema(mode="serialization")
  ```

  Called at line 250: `schema = get_json_schema(model_class)`

  **Should be inlined to:**
  ```python
  # At line 250:
  schema = TypeAdapter(model_class).json_schema(mode="serialization")
  ```

  **Why inline:**
  - Single call site at line 250 (within `generate_pydantic_types`)
  - Simple 2-line function with no complex logic
  - The `adapter` intermediate variable is only used once, so it should be inlined too
  - Function name doesn't add semantic clarity beyond the chained method call
  - Reduces indirection - the inline version is just as readable
  - TypeAdapter is already imported, so no additional imports needed

  **After inlining:**
  Delete the `get_json_schema` function entirely (lines 183-186).
