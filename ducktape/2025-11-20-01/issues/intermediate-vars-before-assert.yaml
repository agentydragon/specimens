  Lines 89-94, 96-101, 113-116, 124-132 extract list values into intermediate variables
  (fc1, fco1, fc2, fco2) and immediately use them once in assertions. These single-use
  variables should be inlined directly into the assert_that() calls.

  Variables used exactly once add no semantic clarity and make tests longer. Standard
  pattern: only extract when used multiple times or when the variable name clarifies
  a complex expression. Here fc1/fco1 names don't clarify turn2_input[ri1_idx + 1].

  Note: Lines 19-32 fc1/fc2 definitions are fine - they're used in response sequence
  construction, not single-use assertions.
