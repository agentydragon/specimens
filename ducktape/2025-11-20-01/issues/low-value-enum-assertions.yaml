rationale: |
  The test contains low-value enum assertions that just duplicate production code definitions.

  **Current code (lines 149-150):**
  ```python
  @pytest.mark.asyncio
  async def test_token_role_enum(self):
      """Test TokenRole enum values."""
      assert TokenRole.HUMAN == "human"
      assert TokenRole.AGENT == "agent"

      # Test that enum can be created from string
      role = TokenRole("human")
      assert role == TokenRole.HUMAN
  ```

  **Why these assertions are low-value:**
  - Lines 149-150 just assert the enum values equal their string representations
  - This duplicates what's already in the production code definition
  - If someone changes the enum value, they'll see it immediately without needing a test
  - The assertions don't test any meaningful behavior

  **What should stay:**
  Lines 152-154 (testing enum construction from string) have value because they test
  actual behavior rather than just duplicating definitions. Keep these.

  **Recommended fix:**
  Delete assertions at lines 149-150. Keep the string-to-enum construction test (lines 152-154)
  as it verifies actual parsing behavior.
