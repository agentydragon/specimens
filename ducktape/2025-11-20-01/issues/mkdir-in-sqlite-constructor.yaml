  Lines cli.py:114-115 and app.py:152-153 manually call db_path.parent.mkdir() before
  instantiating SQLitePersistence. This duplicated directory setup should be handled
  internally by SQLitePersistence.__init__.

  Problems: violates DRY (every caller must remember mkdir), error-prone (forgetting
  mkdir yields cryptic SQLite errors), leaks implementation detail (callers shouldn't
  need to know SQLite requires parent directories), multiple call sites risk inconsistency.

  Move mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True) into SQLitePersistence.__init__ (lines 44-50).
  This is safe - mkdir is idempotent, and constructors are the right place for ensuring
  prerequisites. Benefits: simpler caller code, single responsibility, consistent behavior
  across all instances.
