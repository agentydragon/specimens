rationale: |
  The `PolicyGatewayError` model (lines 33-37) has a `data: dict[str, Any] | None`
  field that's too vague.

  Field name "data" is generic; type `dict[str, Any]` provides no guidance on
  structure/contents; no documentation. Usage (line 136) checks for
  POLICY_GATEWAY_STAMP_KEY, but this isn't reflected in type or name. Unclear what
  other fields exist besides stamp key.

  **Fix options:**
  1. Create typed model `PolicyGatewayErrorData` with `_policy_gateway_stamp: bool`
     field (plus other discovered fields), use as type
  2. Add Field description documenting exact contents (must contain stamp key, list
     other specific fields)
  3. Rename to more specific name (e.g., `mcp_error_metadata`)

  Don't add generic documentation like "data associated with the error". Real
  documentation requires understanding what actually gets stored and documenting
  specifics.
