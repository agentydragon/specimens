rationale: |
  Lines 211-220 define notify_proposal_change with str signature, but all three callers
  (lines 236, 253, 258) have int proposal_id and must explicitly convert with str().
  This indicates wrong method signature.

  Problem: all callers (create_proposal line 239, approve_proposal line 239, reject_proposal
  line 255) have proposal_id as int in their signatures, persistence layer likely uses
  int, URI formatting at line 217 works fine with int (f-string converts automatically),
  unnecessary conversions add cognitive load.

  Change notify_proposal_change signature to accept int instead of str. Callers can then
  pass int directly without conversion. Benefits: eliminates unnecessary conversions,
  makes type consistency clear, aligns with persistence layer.

  Related to issue 022 about using wrong ID in create_proposal.
