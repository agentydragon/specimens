  Test file has unnecessary `__main__` block.

  Lines 153-154 in test_policy_validation_reload.py contain:
  ```python
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      pytest.main([__file__, "-v"])
  ```

  Pytest tests shouldn't have `__main__` blocks. Run with `pytest` command instead. This is an outdated pattern.
