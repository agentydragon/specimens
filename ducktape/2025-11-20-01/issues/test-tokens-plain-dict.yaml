  The `test_tokens` fixture (lines 15-21) uses plain dict instead of Pydantic model for type safety.

  Why this is problematic:
  - Test data doesn't match production types (loses type safety)
  - Type errors only caught at runtime, not at test construction
  - Refactoring is unsafe (Pydantic model changes won't break tests immediately)
  - Structure is implicit rather than explicit

  Recommended fix: Use TokenConfig or similar Pydantic model to construct test data. This ensures test data
  matches production types, catches errors early, and makes refactoring safer.
