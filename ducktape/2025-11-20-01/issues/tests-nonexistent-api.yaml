rationale: |
  The test file `adgn/tests/mcp/approval_policy/test_policy_resources.py` tests a policy
  CRUD API that was never implemented in the production code.

  **Problem:**
  The test imports and uses types that don't exist in the codebase:
  - `CreatePolicyArgs` - for creating policies via admin tools
  - `UpdatePolicyArgs` - for updating policies
  - `DeletePolicyArgs` - for deleting policies

  These test a full policy CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API that was apparently
  planned but never implemented. The actual ApprovalPolicyAdminServer only provides:
  - Proposal management: create_proposal, approve_proposal, reject_proposal
  - Policy operations: set_policy, validate_policy, reload_policy

  There is no separate "create_policy", "update_policy", or "delete_policy" tool/functionality.
  The test file appears to be a placeholder or leftover from an earlier design.

  **Evidence:**
  - Test imports CreatePolicyArgs, UpdatePolicyArgs, DeletePolicyArgs (line 11-14)
  - All test classes (TestPolicyListResource, TestPolicyDetailResource, TestCreatePolicyTool,
    TestUpdatePolicyTool, TestDeletePolicyTool, TestPolicyPagination, TestErrorHandling)
    reference these non-existent types
  - The production code uses a different model: policies are managed through proposals
    (create → approve) rather than direct CRUD operations

  **Resolution:**
  Delete this test file entirely. It tests functionality that was never built and would
  require significant production code implementation to make valid. The actual policy
  functionality is tested in test_policy_validation_reload.py and test_proposals_resources.py.

  **Alternative considerations:**
  - If direct policy CRUD is desired, it should be implemented in production code first
  - The test could be kept as a specification/TODO, but it's confusing to have failing
    tests for unimplemented features in the main test suite
  - Better to track this as a feature request in documentation rather than broken tests
