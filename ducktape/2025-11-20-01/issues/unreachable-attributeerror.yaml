  event_renderer.py lines 85-89 have an AttributeError fallback in _render_tool_result
  that can never be triggered. The try-except catches AttributeError when calling
  model_dump() on result.content blocks, falling back to raw content.

  Why unreachable: (1) CallToolResult.content (from fastmcp.client.client) contains
  MCP content types (TextContent, ImageContent, etc.), (2) all MCP content types
  are Pydantic BaseModels (from mcp.types), (3) all Pydantic models have model_dump(),
  cannot raise AttributeError, (4) FastMCP validates content via TypeAdapter before
  reaching event_renderer (calltool.py:51).

  The only way AttributeError could occur: manual construction of CallToolResult
  with non-Pydantic objects, violating type annotations. This is a programmer error
  that should fail loudly.

  Delete the try-except. Keep only: data = [block.model_dump(by_alias=True) for
  block in result.content].

  Benefits: Removes dead code, removes misleading comment, clearer code without
  defensive fallback for impossible case, violations get clear errors instead of
  silent fallback.
