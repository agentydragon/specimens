rationale: |
  The code uses `open()` with manual read when `Path.read_text()` is cleaner and more idiomatic.

  **Current code (lines 52-53):**
  ```python
  with open(python_file) as f:
      code = f.read()
  ```

  **Should be:**
  ```python
  code = python_file.read_text()
  ```

  **Why Path.read_text() is better:**
  - `python_file` is already a `Path` object (line 47 signature shows `Path`)
  - `Path.read_text()` handles encoding automatically (defaults to locale encoding)
  - More concise - one line instead of two
  - Consistent with line 174 which already uses `output_file.write_text(ts_code)`
  - No need for manual context manager
  - More idiomatic modern Python

  **Context preservation:**
  The current code executes the file with `exec(code, namespace)` at line 54, so the code
  string is still needed. This is not about removing the intermediate variable, just using
  the cleaner Path API.
