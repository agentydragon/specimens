rationale: |
  Fixture contains unnecessary variable and docstring.

  The `persistence` fixture in test_policy_resources.py lines 19-25 has:
  - Single-use variable `db_path` that should be inlined
  - Docstring that adds no value (function name and code are self-documenting)

  Should be simplified to:
  ```python
  @pytest.fixture
  async def persistence(tmp_path):
      persist = SQLitePersistence(tmp_path / "test.db")
      await persist.ensure_schema()
      return persist
  ```
