rationale: |
  The `abort_run` function (L672-689) is a trivial alias that wraps `abort_agent` (L642-651), adding
  only a `SimpleOk` return value. It should be deleted.

  **Why this is problematic:**

  1. **Unnecessary alias**: The function just calls `abort_agent` and wraps the result in `SimpleOk`.
     This provides no value - callers should just call `abort_agent` directly.
  2. **Confusing API**: Having two functions that do the same thing creates confusion about which
     one to use.
  3. **Return type inconsistency**: `None` vs `SimpleOk`.
     This is described as "for consistency" but it's actually inconsistent - now there are two
     different return types for the same operation.
  4. **Verbose docstring for trivial code**: 15-line docstring on a 2-line function.
  5. **Misleading docstring**: Says "This is a semantic alias for abort_agent that returns SimpleOk
     for consistency." What consistency? If it's just an alias, why does it exist?
  6. **YAGNI violation**: There's no evidence that this alias is needed. If some callers prefer
     `SimpleOk` return type, they can wrap it themselves.

  Delete L672-689 entirely. Callers should use `abort_agent` directly and wrap in `SimpleOk` at call
  site if needed.
