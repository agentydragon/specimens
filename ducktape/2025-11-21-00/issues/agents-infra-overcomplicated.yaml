rationale: |
  The agents MCP bridge uses a complex two-layer observer pattern (business logic → callbacks
  → AgentsServer → MCP clients) instead of the simpler compositor pattern already used
  successfully on the agent side.

  **Current Architecture Problems:**

  1. **Two-layer complexity:** Business logic calls sync callbacks that schedule async tasks
     that eventually broadcast. Lines 833-932 contain ~100 lines of factory functions.

  2. **Clobbered notifier bug:** ApprovalPolicyEngine has only ONE notifier slot. When
     agents.py:855 wires its notifier, it replaces the one from ApprovalPolicyServer.

  3. **Monolithic server:** AgentsServer aggregates resources from 6+ business logic classes.

  4. **URI scoping inconsistency:** Global URIs (`resource://approval-policy/*`) mixed with
     agent-scoped URIs (`resource://agents/{id}/*`).

  **Better: Compositor Pattern**

  Replace monolithic AgentsServer with small focused servers mounted in a compositor, like
  the agent-side does (agent/runtime/infrastructure.py:100-114). Each server wraps one
  business logic class and directly broadcasts MCP notifications.

  Example structure:
  - ApprovalPolicyServer wraps ApprovalPolicyEngine
  - ApprovalsServer wraps ApprovalHub
  - SessionStateServer wraps Session
  - AgentRegistryServer wraps AgentRegistry

  Mount all in compositor with proper namespacing (`agent_{id}_policy`, etc.). Notifications
  propagate automatically via compositor's _ChildHandler (compositor/server.py:446-469).
  Delete the ~100 lines of manual wiring code (lines 833-932).
