  The `boot_agent` docstring (lines 815-829) has Args and Returns sections that
  restate the function signature.

  Args section: "agent_id: ID of the agent to boot" restates parameter name, function
  name, and type annotation `agent_id: AgentID`.

  Returns section: "SimpleOk confirming the agent is ready" restates return type
  annotation `-> SimpleOk` and obvious success/fail pattern.

  Summary (what/why) and Raises (KeyError on missing agent) are valuable; Args/Returns
  add zero information.

  **Fix:** Delete Args/Returns sections, keep summary and Raises. Reduces docstring
  from 15 to 9 lines, no redundancy, keeps only valuable information. Args/Returns
  should only be included when they provide information beyond the type signature.
