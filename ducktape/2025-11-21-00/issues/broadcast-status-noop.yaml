  L223-225 define `broadcast_status` as a no-op with comment "WebSocket status broadcasts
  removed". This is dead code: the method does nothing (`pass`), the comment confirms
  the functionality was intentionally removed (not temporarily stubbed), and all call sites
  just await a no-op.

  Four call sites: line 140 `await self.broadcast_status(True, active)`, line 162 (same),
  line 395 `await self._manager.broadcast_status(True, run_id)`, line 443
  `await self._manager.broadcast_status(True, None)`.

  Delete the method and all four calls.
