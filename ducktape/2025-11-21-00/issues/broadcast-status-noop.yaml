  Lines 223-225 define `broadcast_status` as a no-op with comment "WebSocket status broadcasts
  removed". This is dead code: the method does nothing (explicit pass), the comment confirms
  the functionality was intentionally removed (not temporarily stubbed), and all call sites
  await a no-op wasting cycles.

  Four call sites: line 140 `await self.broadcast_status(True, active)`, line 162 (same),
  line 395 `await self._manager.broadcast_status(True, run_id)`, line 443
  `await self._manager.broadcast_status(True, None)`.

  Delete the method definition and all four call sites. Since it's a no-op, removal has zero
  behavioral change. Keeping dead code creates maintenance burden and confuses readers.
