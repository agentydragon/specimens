rationale: |
  The logic for reading and parsing the daemon PID file is duplicated in two places:
  wt_client.py lines 108-113 (is_daemon_running) and handlers.py lines 250-258 (kill_daemon).
  Both follow the same pattern: async read via `asyncio.to_thread`, strip, check if empty,
  parse int.

  **Why this is problematic:**
  - Same pattern repeated in two locations
  - Changes to PID file format or error handling must update multiple places
  - Risk of inconsistent behavior if one location is updated but not the other
  - Violates DRY principle

  **Fix:** Extract into a shared `async def read_daemon_pid(pid_path: Path) -> int | None`
  helper that handles the read, strip, empty check, and int parse with error handling.
  Returns PID as int if valid, None otherwise. Benefits: single source of truth, easier
  to maintain, consistent error handling, more testable. Note: line 536 in wt_client.py
  also reads the PID file but synchronously for debug output (different requirements,
  fine as-is).
