  Line 130 imports `from .events import EventRecord, TypedPayload  # noqa: E402`, using
  `# noqa: E402` to suppress "module level import not at top of file" linting error.

  Problems: (1) Suppresses legitimate linting error - real code smell should be fixed, not
  suppressed. (2) Violates PEP 8 - imports should be at top after module docstring.
  (3) Hides potential circular import - `noqa` suggests circular dependency being papered
  over. (4) Inconsistent with rest of file - all other imports (lines 1-10) are at top.
  (5) Scattered imports make dependencies hard to see at a glance.

  Recommended approaches: (1) If circular import, refactor - move EventRecord/TypedPayload
  to separate `types.py`, have both `__init__.py` and `events.py` import from it.
  (2) If no circular dependency, move import to top. (3) If TYPE_CHECKING needed for forward
  refs, use `if TYPE_CHECKING:` block at top.

  Check if circular import actually exists by trying to move import to top. If fails,
  refactor module structure to break cycle rather than suppressing warning.
