  Lines 150-158 create a ToolCallRecord with 6 fields (call_id, run_id, agent_id, tool_call,
  decision=None, execution=None) and assign it to `pending_record`, which is used exactly once
  on line 158 for `save_tool_call()`.

  Single-use variables add cognitive overhead without providing value. Inline the construction
  directly into the save call to eliminate the unnecessary intermediate variable.
