  Line 151 assigns database query result to `proposals` variable, which is used exactly once
  in the list comprehension on lines 152-160. Single-use variables add cognitive overhead
  without providing value.

  Inline the query directly into the comprehension: move the `await` expression into the
  `for p in ...` clause. This is valid Python syntax and makes it clearer that the query
  result is only used for the comprehension.
