rationale: |
  Line 407 in agents.py manually constructs a resource URI using an f-string
  instead of using a centralized constant from _shared/constants.py. The codebase
  has URI format constants (e.g., AGENTS_APPROVALS_PENDING_URI_FMT) but individual
  approval URIs are constructed inline.

  **Problems:**
  - Violates centralization principle (constants.py exists for this)
  - Inconsistent with rest of codebase which imports URI constants
  - Hard to change URI patterns globally
  - Risk of typos in manual construction
  - No single source of truth for URI patterns

  **Fix:** Add AGENTS_APPROVAL_URI_FMT constant to constants.py, then import and
  use it: `AGENTS_APPROVAL_URI_FMT.format(agent_id=..., call_id=...)`. This pattern
  should apply to all manual URI constructions in the codebase.
