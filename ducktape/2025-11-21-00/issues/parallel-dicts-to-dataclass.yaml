rationale: |
  ApprovalHub maintains two parallel dicts keyed by call_id (lines 75-78): `_futures` and
  `_requests`. They must be kept in sync manually, which is error-prone.

  **Evidence of parallel management:**
  - Line 94: `self._requests[call_id] = request`
  - Line 98: `self._futures[call_id] = fut`
  - Lines 104-105: both dicts popped together
  - Lines 95-96: checking futures but not requests (asymmetry suggests potential bugs)

  **Why parallel dicts are problematic:**
  - Synchronization burden: must keep both dicts in sync manually
  - Error-prone: easy to update one dict and forget the other
  - Unclear lifecycle: not obvious entries come and go together
  - No type safety: can't enforce both dicts have same keys

  **Fix:** Create a `PendingApproval` dataclass with `request` and `future` fields, use a
  single `_pending: dict[str, PendingApproval]`. Update methods to work with the unified
  structure. The `pending` property (lines 111-114) extracts requests from dataclass entries.
  Benefits: single source of truth, impossible to have mismatched state, type-safe, clearer
  lifecycle, easier to extend.
