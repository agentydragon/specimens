  Line 178 defines `PolicyProposalInfo` with a `proposal_uri` field that is trivially computable
  from the `id` field via `f"{APPROVAL_POLICY_PROPOSALS_INDEX_URI}/{id}"`.

  This creates redundancy and inconsistency risk: storing both `id` and `proposal_uri` violates
  DRY when one is derivable from the other. If the URI pattern changes, both the construction
  logic and this field must be updated. The field also bloats response payloads when listing
  many proposals.

  The codebase uses IDs as primary identifiers elsewhere, not URIs. Mixing both creates
  confusion about which is canonical.

  Remove `proposal_uri` field from the model; clients can construct URIs on-demand from IDs.
  Benefits: single source of truth, smaller payloads, no sync risk, consistency with ID-based
  patterns.
