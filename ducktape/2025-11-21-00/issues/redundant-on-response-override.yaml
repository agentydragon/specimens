rationale: |
  The `on_response` method in `ConnectionManager` (lines 167-168) is a redundant override
  that should be deleted.

  **Current code (lines 167-168):**
  ```python
  def on_response(self, evt: Any) -> None:
      return None
  ```

  **Why delete:**
  - ConnectionManager extends BaseHandler (line 52)
  - BaseHandler.on_response is already a no-op (handler.py:133-138):
    ```python
    def on_response(self, evt: Response) -> None:
        """Called after receiving a complete model response with usage stats.

        Default: no-op.
        """
        return
    ```
  - Overriding a no-op with another no-op is pointless
  - No callers found (grep showed 0 call sites)
  - Identical behavior whether override exists or not

  **What to delete:**
  Just remove lines 167-168 entirely. The base class implementation will be used.

  **Type note:**
  The override uses `evt: Any` while base class uses `evt: Response`. This suggests
  the override might have been added when types were unclear, but it's still doing nothing.

  **Benefits of deletion:**
  - Less code to maintain
  - Removes confusion about why override exists
  - Clearer that default behavior is being used
  - One less place to look when searching for on_response implementations
