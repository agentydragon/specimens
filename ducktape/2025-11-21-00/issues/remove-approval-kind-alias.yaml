  Line 41 defines `ApprovalKind = UserApprovalDecision` type alias. Used in state.py:73,
  state.py:130, servers/agents.py:30, servers/agents.py:609.

  Alias adds no semantic value: doesn't convey anything different from UserApprovalDecision,
  adds indirection (readers must look up), inconsistent naming (actual type has different
  name), not a true abstraction (1:1 with no behavior), import clutter.

  Fix: remove alias (line 41), replace all usages with `UserApprovalDecision` directly.
  Benefits: one canonical name, clearer code, less cognitive overhead, easier to search/refactor.
