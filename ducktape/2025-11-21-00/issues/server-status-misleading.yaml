rationale: |
  L197-201 define `ServerStatus` enum with docstring "Agent server runtime status" and values
  `RUNNING`/`STOPPED`. L216 includes `status: ServerStatus` field in `AgentInfoDetailed` model.

  This is misleading: name suggests server status, but actually tracks local agent status (not server).
  For remote agents (`mode == AgentMode.REMOTE`), neither "running" nor "stopped" are semantically
  correct (we don't know if remote agent is running, and "stopped" implies control we don't have).
  Status confuses local infrastructure availability with agent operational state. Unclear semantics:
  does "running" mean process running, infrastructure loaded, processing request, or registered?

  Needs redesign for clearer semantics and correct remote agent modeling.
