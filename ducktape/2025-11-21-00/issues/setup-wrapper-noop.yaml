  Lines 578-585 define _setup_wrapper() as an explicit no-op "kept for future
  extensibility." Docstring says functionality works without this method. Line
  519 calls it once. This is a YAGNI violation.

  **Why delete:**
  - Explicit no-op with no current value
  - Speculative "future extensibility" - may never be needed
  - Single caller doing nothing useful
  - Maintenance burden and misleading to readers
  - Git history preserves deleted code if needed later

  **What to delete:**
  1. Method definition (lines 578-585)
  2. Call site (line 519): await self._setup_wrapper()
  3. Update comment at line 518 which becomes incorrect

  **Benefits:** Less code, no misleading no-ops, clearer control flow.
