  YAGNI violation:
  L578-585 define _setup_wrapper() as explicit no-op "for future extensibility."
  Docstring says functionality works without this method. L519 calls it once.

  Delete the method (L578-585), call site (L519).
  Update comment at L518 which becomes incorrect

  Benefits: Less code, no misleading no-ops, clearer control flow.
