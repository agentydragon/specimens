rationale: |
  Comments that add no value: either restating obvious code or providing
  incorrect information about field requirements.

  **Pattern 1: Obvious operation comments** (agents.py:785-792)
  Lines 785-792 have three comments that merely restate simple operations:
  generating an agent ID, calling create_agent, and returning a brief.
  Function already has a docstring; these add noise without information.

  **Pattern 2: Incorrect "REQUIRED" comments** (persist/__init__.py)
  Three Pydantic models claim "All fields are REQUIRED" but have optional
  fields with defaults (e.g., Decision.reason has default None). Pydantic
  type annotations already define requirements; comments contradict the code.

  **Problems:**
  - Noise obscures actual code
  - Comments become stale/incorrect as code evolves
  - Redundant: code and type annotations already show what's required
  - Maintenance burden keeping comments synchronized

  **Fix:** Delete these comments. Code operations and Pydantic annotations
  are self-documenting. Comments should explain WHY, not restate WHAT.
