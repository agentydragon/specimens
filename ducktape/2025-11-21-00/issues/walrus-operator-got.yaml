rationale: |
  The `proposal_detail` resource handler should use the walrus operator (`:=`) to combine
  the assignment and None check of the `got` variable into a single expression.

  **Current code (lines 165-167):**
  ```python
  got = await self._engine.persistence.get_policy_proposal(self._engine.agent_id, id)
  if got is None:
      raise KeyError(id)
  ```

  **Why this should be improved:**
  - The pattern "assign, then immediately check for None" is verbose
  - Python 3.8+ walrus operator allows combining assignment with conditional
  - Reduces visual noise and makes the None-check pattern more obvious
  - Common Python idiom for this pattern

  **Recommended fix:**
  Use walrus operator to combine assignment and check:
  ```python
  if (got := await self._engine.persistence.get_policy_proposal(self._engine.agent_id, id)) is None:
      raise KeyError(id)
  ```

  **Benefits:**
  - More concise (3 lines → 2 lines)
  - Emphasizes that this is a "fetch-or-error" pattern
  - Eliminates the gap between assignment and usage
  - Modern Python idiom widely used in the codebase

  **Note:**
  This is a simple readability improvement that doesn't change behavior.
