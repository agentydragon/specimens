rationale: |
  AgentsSidebar.svelte line 347 contains a useless historical comment: "Backdrop
  styling moved to ModalBackdrop component". This documents a past refactoring
  rather than explaining current behavior.

  Problems: (1) historical note provides no value to readers, (2) ModalBackdrop's
  existence is already obvious from imports and usage, (3) redundant with "Modal
  styles" section header.

  Delete the comment. Historical notes ("moved to...", "used to be...") clutter
  code without explaining current behavior. Comments should explain complexity,
  workarounds, or non-obvious behavior, not document past refactorings.
