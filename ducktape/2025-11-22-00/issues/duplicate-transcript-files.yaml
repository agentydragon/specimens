rationale: |
  `TranscriptHandler` writes the same events to two nearly-identical files: `events.jsonl`
  (with timestamps) and `transcript.jsonl` (without timestamps). Lines 38-39 define both
  paths, lines 53-57 write to both files on every event.

  **Problems:**
  1. Redundant storage: same data written twice, only difference is timestamp wrapper
  2. Confusing naming: two files with similar names containing nearly identical content
  3. Performance overhead: double I/O operations for every event
  4. Storage waste: doubles disk usage for large transcripts
  5. Unclear purpose: which file should tools read?

  **Fix:** Choose one format. Keep the timestamped format (`events.jsonl`) as primary since
  it preserves temporal information (timestamps are useful for debugging, analysis, replay;
  you can strip them if needed but can't add them back). Remove `_transcript_path` and the
  second write. If both formats are needed, generate the compact format on-demand from the
  timestamped one via an `export_compact_transcript()` method. Benefits: single source of
  truth, half the I/O, no redundant data, easier maintenance.
