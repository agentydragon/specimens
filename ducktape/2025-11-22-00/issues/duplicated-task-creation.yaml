  cli.py lines 360-368 create identical tasks (update_task, runner, output_task) in
  both branches of an if-else. Only runner construction differs (master_fd vs None).

  Problems: (1) update_task assignment is duplicated identically in both branches,
  (2) runner construction differs only in the master_fd parameter, (3) changes to
  task creation must be duplicated, (4) similarity obscures what actually differs.

  Move common task creation outside the if-else. The branch should decide
  pre-commit mode and master_fd value; task creation should happen once after.
  Create output_task conditionally only if master_fd is not None.

  Benefits: DRY (task creation happens once), clearer intent (branch decides
  pre-commit mode, task creation is separate), easier maintenance (update in one
  place), less duplication.
