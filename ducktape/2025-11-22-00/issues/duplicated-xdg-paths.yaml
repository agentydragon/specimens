rationale: |
  The code constructs XDG user data directory paths (using `user_data_dir("adgn", ...)`)
  in multiple places instead of defining these paths once in a central location.

  **Current implementation:** Each module independently calls `user_data_dir("adgn", "agentydragon")`
  and constructs paths like `DEFAULT_DB_PATH = Path(...) / "mcp-bridge.db"` (mcp_bridge/cli.py, line 36).

  **Problems:**
  1. Duplication: Same platformdirs call in multiple files
  2. Inconsistency risk: Easy to use different app name/author
  3. Hard to change: Must update multiple files
  4. No discoverability: Can't easily find all data paths
  5. Testing difficulty: Can't easily override base directory

  **The correct approach:**
  Create a central paths module (e.g., `adgn/paths.py`) that defines XDG directories once
  (USER_DATA_DIR, USER_CACHE_DIR, USER_CONFIG_DIR) and specific application paths
  (MCP_BRIDGE_DB, RESPONSES_CACHE_DB, AUTH_TOKENS_FILE, etc.). Import these constants
  throughout the codebase.

  **Benefits:**
  1. Single source of truth for all paths
  2. Guaranteed consistency in app name/author
  3. Easy to add environment variable overrides once
  4. Testable: can patch the paths module
  5. Follows XDG Base Directory Specification correctly across platforms
