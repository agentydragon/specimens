rationale: |
  The `generate_commit_message_minicodex()` backend function (minicodex_backend.py, lines
  190-194) calls `configure_logging()` and silences logger levels for several packages.
  Main already has logging configuration (cli.py, lines 490-505, 675 via `_init_logging()`).

  **Problems:**
  1. Duplicate configuration: both main and backend configure logging independently
  2. Conflicting state: backend's `configure_logging()` may override main's setup
  3. Layering violation: backend functions shouldn't configure global state
  4. Hard to test: backend function has side effects on global logging configuration
  5. Inflexible: caller can't control logging behavior (forced to WARNING levels)
  6. Order-dependent: works differently depending on whether main or backend runs first

  **Fix:** Move all logging configuration to the entry point (main). Backend should get
  a logger via `logging.getLogger(__name__)` but NOT configure it. Main's `_init_logging()`
  should handle silencing noisy libraries. Benefits: single responsibility, predictable,
  testable, flexible, composable. General principle: library/backend functions should USE
  logging but NOT CONFIGURE it. Configuration belongs at the application boundary.
