  Class (container.py:17-46) uses manual `__init__` for simple field
  initialization. The constructor does assignment-only initialization
  with no complex logic, perfect candidate for `@dataclass`.

  Benefits of dataclass: less boilerplate (no manual assignments), free
  `__repr__` for debugging, free `__eq__` for testing, type annotations
  serve as field declarations, standard Python idiom for data-holding
  classes. Use `__post_init__` if complex initialization needed.
