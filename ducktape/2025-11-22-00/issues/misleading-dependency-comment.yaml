rationale: |
  The shim.py module docstring (lines 14-17) says "Keep this tiny and dependency-free; only stdlib is used" but
  this is
  misleading. While the shim itself uses only stdlib, policy programs routinely import and use types/enums from
  the
  `adgn`
  package, which is installed in the container image.

  **Why this is misleading:**

  Policy programs typically use adgn package imports:
  ```python
  from adgn.agent.policies.policy_types import PolicyDecision
  from adgn.mcp._shared.naming import build_mcp_function
  return PolicyDecision.ALLOW
  ```

  **The confusion:**

  "Dependency-free" could mean:
  1. The shim.py module doesn't import non-stdlib (TRUE)
  2. Policy programs don't use adgn package (FALSE - they do!)
  3. No external packages needed in container (FALSE - adgn is needed)

  The current wording suggests interpretation #2, which is wrong.

  **Correct approach:**

  Clarify what "dependency-free" means:
  ```python
  Notes:
  - The shim itself only uses stdlib (no third-party imports).
  - Policy programs CAN import from adgn package (installed in container).
  - Container image must have the adgn package installed so both the shim
    (python -m adgn.agent.policy_eval.shim) and policy programs can use it.
  ```

  Or simply remove the misleading statement:
  ```python
  Notes:
  - Container image must have the adgn package installed for both the shim
    execution (python -m adgn.agent.policy_eval.shim) and for policy programs
    to import types/utilities from adgn.
  ```
