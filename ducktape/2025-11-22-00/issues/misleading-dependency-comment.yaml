rationale: |
  The shim.py module docstring (lines 14-17) says "Keep this tiny and dependency-free; only stdlib is used" but
  this is misleading. While the shim itself uses only stdlib, policy programs routinely import and use
  types/enums from the `adgn` package, which is installed in the container image.

  "Dependency-free" could mean:
  1. The shim.py module doesn't import non-stdlib (TRUE)
  2. Policy programs don't use adgn package (FALSE - they do!)
  3. No external packages needed in container (FALSE - adgn is needed)

  The current wording suggests interpretation #2, which is wrong.

  Correct approach: Clarify that the shim itself is stdlib-only, but policy programs can import from adgn
  package, and the container must have adgn installed.
