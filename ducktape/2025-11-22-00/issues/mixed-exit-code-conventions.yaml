rationale: |
  Functions inconsistently mix two conventions for signaling exit codes: some declare
  `-> int` return types but actually raise `ExitWithCode` exceptions on error paths.

  **Evidence:**
  - `_commit_immediately` (lines 558-564): declared `-> int`, but raises `ExitWithCode(1)` on some paths
  - `_run_editor_flow` (lines 567-609): declared `-> int`, but has 7 paths that raise `ExitWithCode`
  - Callers (lines 728-732): expect int return, but `sys.exit(code)` is unreachable when exception raised

  **Problems:**
  1. Type lies: functions promise `-> int` but raise exceptions, violating contracts
  2. Unreachable code: code after exception-raising calls never executes
  3. Easy to forget: callers must remember BOTH to check returns AND catch exceptions
  4. No guidance: new code has no clear pattern to follow

  **Fix:** Pick ONE convention consistently. Option A (always raise exceptions, change
  signatures to `-> None`): impossible to forget, clear failure paths, consistent with
  Python's `SystemExit`. Option B (always return int): never raise, always return codes.
  Mixing both violates type contracts and creates ad-hoc error handling.
