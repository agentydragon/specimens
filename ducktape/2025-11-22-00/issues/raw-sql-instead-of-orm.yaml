  Query (sqlite.py:145-165) uses raw SQL with `text()` instead of SQLAlchemy
  ORM constructs. The function executes a SELECT with GROUP BY and COALESCE
  using string-based column references.

  Problems with raw SQL: not type-safe (columns as strings), not portable
  (SQL syntax varies), hard to maintain (refactoring tools don't track
  renames), poor error messages (runtime vs import time), no IDE navigation.

  Fix: use SQLAlchemy ORM with `session.query(Run.agent_id, func.coalesce(...)).group_by()`.
  Benefits: type-safe references, database portability, refactoring support,
  better errors, IDE navigation.
