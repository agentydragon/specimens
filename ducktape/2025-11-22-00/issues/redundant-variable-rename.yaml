  Variables are renamed without adding clarity or semantic meaning.

  Location 1 (runner.py:32): parameter `docker_client` is immediately
  renamed to `client`. No value added - either rename the parameter itself
  or use `docker_client` throughout.

  Location 2 (cli.py:581): `final_text` is renamed to `content_before`,
  but both names mean the same thing. Use the semantic name from the start.

  Problems: extra variables to track, confusion about which name to use,
  more code, cognitive load. Fix: use one consistent name throughout.
