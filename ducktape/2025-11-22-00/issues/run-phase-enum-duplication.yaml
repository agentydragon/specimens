rationale: |
  Three run phase/status enums exist with different granularity, causing name
  collisions, unclear subset relationships, and lost information when converting.

  status_shared.py RunPhase (7 states): distinguishes TOOLS_RUNNING from SAMPLING
  via determine_run_phase() logic (lines 42-56). mcp_bridge/types.py RunPhase
  (3 states): cannot make this distinction. protocol.py RunStatus (7 states):
  lifecycle-focused (STARTING/FINISHED) rather than execution phase.

  Impact: Name collision (two RunPhase enums), conversion overhead, coarser enums
  lose information (can't distinguish tool execution from sampling).

  Use status_shared.RunPhase everywhere. Delete mcp_bridge RunPhase. If RunStatus
  tracks a different dimension (lifecycle vs execution phase), rename to clarify
  (e.g., AgentLifecycle). For code needing coarser granularity, write mapping
  functions from the comprehensive enum.

  Principle: One enum per dimension, most granular wins. Derive coarser projections
  rather than maintaining multiple enums.
