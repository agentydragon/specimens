rationale: |
  `LocalAgentRuntime` has lifecycle issues: missing type annotations
  (ui_bus, connection_manager at 81-82), "may be initialized" antipattern
  (session/agent nullable at 85-88, runtime checks at 155-158), incomplete
  cleanup (close() doesn't null fields at 160-165), and not being a proper
  context manager despite having start()/close() methods.

  "May be initialized" antipattern impact: object exists but isn't usable
  (half-initialized), every method must check initialization, type system
  can't help (fields are `T | None`), easy to forget start() call.

  Solutions: (1) async context manager (move start() logic to __aenter__,
  cleanup to __aexit__, automatic lifecycle, strong types, guaranteed
  cleanup), or (2) factory pattern (classmethod create() with async init,
  manual lifecycle but strong types).

  Current approach: manual unclear lifecycle, weak type safety, incomplete
  cleanup.
