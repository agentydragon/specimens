rationale: |
  Four locations create intermediate variables used only once in the immediately
  following statement: runner.py lines 44-45 assign cmd/env before passing to
  containers.create; cli.py lines 577-578 assign edit_path before write_text;
  cli.py lines 592-594 assign saved boolean before if check; sqlite.py line 246
  assigns policies before list comprehension.

  Problems: One-off variables add cognitive load, provide no semantic value (names
  don't clarify intent), require extra lines to read, unnecessarily widen variable
  scope.

  Inline values directly at their use sites. Benefits: fewer variables to track,
  more concise code, clearer single-use intent, smaller variable scope.
