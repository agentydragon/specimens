    Four Svelte components create independent MCP client connections: AgentsSidebar (line 85), ChatPane
    (lines 87-91 and 124-128 - TWO separate clients in same component), MessageComposer (lines 16-20),
    and GlobalApprovalsList (lines 69-71 targeting non-existent /api/mcp endpoint).

    Each client creation involves handshake, auth, session setup, and dedicated connection. This wastes
    resources (multiple WebSocket/HTTP connections, repeated handshakes, memory/file descriptors), violates
    2-level compositor architecture (intended: UI → shared client → compositor; actual: parallel connections),
    creates inconsistent state (separate sessions don't coordinate, race conditions), and duplicates connection
    management (multiple reconnection paths, error handling, token refresh).

    Create global MCP client store/context (e.g., `stores/mcp-client.ts` with `mcpClient` writable), initialize
    once at app startup, and have all components import and use the shared client. This provides single connection,
    consistent state, centralized reconnection, and proper resource subscriptions.

    GlobalApprovalsList: delete component until backend supports it, or expose global approvals through shared compositor.
