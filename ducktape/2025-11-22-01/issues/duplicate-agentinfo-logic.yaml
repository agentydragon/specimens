rationale: |
  Lines 67-100 (`list_agents`) and 108-135 (`get_agent_info`) duplicate identical logic
  for computing AgentInfo from registry state.

  Duplicated sequence: get mode, get infrastructure, compute live status, initialize
  pending_approvals/run_phase, conditionally count approvals and derive run_phase,
  compute is_local, construct AgentInfo.

  Only difference: error handling (list_agents continues on KeyError, get_agent_info
  raises with message).

  Fix: extract `_compute_agent_info(agent_id) -> AgentInfo` helper that does the
  computation. Simplify both handlers to call the helper with appropriate error handling.

  Benefits: single source of truth, easier testing, reusable, clearer separation.
