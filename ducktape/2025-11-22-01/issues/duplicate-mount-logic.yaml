rationale: |
  Lines 95-103 in `create_global_compositor` duplicate the mounting logic from
  `mount_agent_compositor_dynamically` (lines 113-130).

  Both do: create agent compositor, mount at `f"agent{agent_id}"`, log. Startup version
  (95-103) wraps in try/except to continue on failure. Dynamic version (113-130) doesn't.

  Problems: maintenance burden (sync changes), inconsistency risk (logic drift), different
  error handling (startup suppresses, dynamic doesn't), different logging messages.

  Fix: call `mount_agent_compositor_dynamically` in the startup loop. Remove try/except
  (see issue 003 for fail-fast rationale). Benefits: single source of truth, consistent
  behavior, less code, uniform error handling.
