// Merged: imperative-list-building, imperative-approvals-list, imperative-proposals-list

  rationale=|||
    Three functions build lists imperatively using `append()` in loops instead of list comprehensions.

    Lines 50-59 in agents.py define `_convert_pending_approvals()` that initializes empty list,
    loops over `pending_map.items()`, and appends `PendingApproval` objects. The function doesn't
    use `call_id`, so should iterate `.values()` directly.

    Lines 64-108 in approvals_bridge.py build `approvals_list` with two separate loops: lines 71-80
    append pending approvals, lines 99-108 append decided approvals (with conditional). Both should
    use comprehensions and combine via `pending_approvals + decided_approvals`.

    Lines 267-274 in runtime.py build `proposals` list with nested conditional and loop: checks
    persistence/agent_id, iterates rows, creates intermediate `pid`/`raw` vars, appends. Should use
    conditional expression with comprehension.

    Replace imperative `result = []; for x in items: result.append(transform(x))` pattern with
    comprehensions: `[transform(x) for x in items]`. This is more concise, Pythonic, immutable
    (no list mutation), and clearer intent.
