rationale: |
  The `create_agent_compositor` function creates intermediate variables `policy_server`
  (line 48) and `approvals_server` (lines 53-57) that are used exactly once in the
  immediately following `mount_inproc()` call. These add no clarity and should be inlined.

  Problems: (1) Unnecessary binding - variables never referenced again. (2) Name pollution -
  add no semantic value. (3) Cognitive load - reader tracks "what is this for?". (4) Not
  used in logging or error handling. (5) False complexity - suggests variable might be
  used later.

  Why they exist: Likely habit from longer functions where variables were reused, possibly
  for debugging (but not used in logging), or copy-pasted from code where needed.

  Inline the constructors directly into `mount_inproc()` calls. Server types are clear from
  class names, construction is straightforward, and values are used once. Python idiom
  encourages inline construction for single-use values.
