  Multiple functions have Args sections in docstrings that simply restate information
  already obvious from type annotations and parameter names.

  Examples: `create_agent(agent_id: AgentID)` documents "Unique identifier for the new
  agent" (obvious from type and name), `approve(call_id: str, reasoning: str | None)`
  documents "ID of the tool call" and "Optional reasoning" (obvious from types).

  Args sections should explain WHY or HOW, not WHAT (already clear from signature).
  Remove Args that restate type info. Keep only Args that add non-obvious semantic
  information (e.g., retry behavior, validation rules, side effects).
