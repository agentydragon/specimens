rationale: |
  The `pending_count` field in `ApprovalsResponse` is redundant because it's derived
  information that can be computed from the already-returned `approvals` list by counting
  items with `status == ApprovalStatus.PENDING`.

  Current implementation manually counts pending approvals while building the list:
  ```python
  pending_count = 0
  # ...
  for call_id, tool_call in pending_map.items():
      approvals_list.append(...)
      pending_count += 1
  ```

  This violates DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) - the client already has all the information
  needed to compute pending_count from the approvals list.

  Fix: Remove the `pending_count` and `decided_count` fields from `ApprovalsResponse`.
  Clients can compute these values trivially:
  ```python
  pending_count = len([a for a in approvals if a.status == ApprovalStatus.PENDING])
  decided_count = len([a for a in approvals if a.status != ApprovalStatus.PENDING])
  ```

  This simplifies the server code and reduces the chance of count/list mismatch bugs.
