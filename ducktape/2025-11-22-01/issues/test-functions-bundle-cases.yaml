rationale: |
  Test functions bundle multiple independent cases that should be split or parameterized.

  **Three forms:**

  1. Lines 355-476: 5 sequential subtests (text content, image content, error content,
     mixed, empty). Each creates CallToolResult, saves, retrieves, asserts independently.

  2. Lines 533-640: 4+ sequential subtests (corrupt JSON, missing field, non-existent
     call_id, malformed timestamp). Each manipulates database, asserts different errors.

  3. Lines 288-351: Loop iterating over 6 outcome scenarios (POLICY_ALLOW,
     POLICY_DENY_ABORT, USER_APPROVE, etc.).

  **Problems:**
  - If case N fails, cases N+1 never run
  - Can't identify which scenario failed from test name
  - Can't run individual cases via `pytest -k`
  - Violates pytest convention (one test = one thing)
  - No parallel execution even with pytest-xdist

  **Fix:** Split sequential subtests into separate functions with descriptive names
  (e.g., `test_calltoolresult_text_content`). For loops, use `@pytest.mark.parametrize`.
  Benefits: failure isolation, clear names, individual execution, parallel support.
