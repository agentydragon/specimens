  Lines 95-96 in `await_decision` use a two-line pattern: get a value, check if None.
  The walrus operator provides a cleaner one-line solution for this exact pattern.

  Current: `pending = self._pending.get(call_id)` then `if pending is None:`. This is
  verbose (two lines), pollutes scope (pending exists outside if/else), and less Pythonic.

  Replace with: `if (pending := self._pending.get(call_id)) is None:`. Benefits: more
  concise, clearer scope (pending only in else branch where used), idiomatic Python 3.8+
  (PEP 572).

  Note: Line 106 has similar pattern but is correct because pending appears in the
  condition itself, not just the None check.
