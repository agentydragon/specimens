Stateless two-step demos — reasoning and tool replay

This directory contains concise, runnable examples that demonstrate the stateless
Responses API workflow for preserving model reasoning (chain-of-thought) across
turns and replaying function_call/tool outputs when continuing a turn.

Files
- stateless_two_step_demo.py
  - Combined demo that runs both a text-only two-step continuation and a
    tools two-step continuation. Shows how to reproduce the exact prefix the
    model saw (prompt1, reasoning1, assistant1[, function_call]) and then send
    a new prompt so the model can continue statelessly.

Running
1. Install dependencies and set credentials:
   - export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
   - pip install -r requirements.txt   # if you use a local venv; the project already pins the OpenAI SDK in dev
2. Run the demo:
   - python examples/stateless_two_step_demo.py text   # text-only demo
   - python examples/stateless_two_step_demo.py tools  # tools demo (function_call + replayed tool outputs)
   - python examples/stateless_two_step_demo.py both   # runs both demos

Design notes (brief)
- Stateless mode: the examples intentionally do NOT rely on previous_response_id or
  server-side state. Instead they reproduce the full input list that the model
  originally saw when it produced a reasoning item, then append the next user
  prompt. This is the stateless way to continue a chain-of-thought and/or
  supply function_call_output values.
- Safety: reasoning items are treated as opaque, integrity-protected objects by
  the Responses API; the examples forward the exact SDK-returned objects rather
  than fabricating or mutating them.

Integration note: The agent loop (MiniCodex) references these demos as
examples for how to serialize transcript items for stateless continuation.

If you want I can also append a short section to CLAUDE.md describing these
examples and linking to this README (confirm and I'll edit CLAUDE.md).
