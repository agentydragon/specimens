rationale: |
  The ApprovalItem model has a `timestamp` field whose meaning is ambiguous:

  ```python
  class ApprovalItem(BaseModel):
      """A single approval (pending or decided)."""
      call_id: str
      tool_call: ToolCall
      status: ApprovalStatus
      reason: str | None = None
      timestamp: datetime  # What does this represent?
  ```

  Looking at usage patterns reveals inconsistent semantics:
  - **Pending approvals** (line 167): `timestamp=datetime.now()` - uses current time when building the list
  - **Decided approvals** (line 189): `timestamp=record.decision.decided_at` - uses the decision time

  The field name "timestamp" doesn't clarify what event it's timestamping:
  - Is it when the tool call was requested?
  - When the approval decision was made?
  - When the approval item was last updated?

  For decided approvals it's explicitly the decision time (`decided_at`), but for pending approvals it's just
  "now"
  which
  is actually neither the request time nor a decision time. This semantic inconsistency makes the field unclear
  and
  potentially misleading.

  **Fix:**
  Rename to be more specific about what is being timestamped. Options include:
  - `updated_at` - if it represents last update time for both states
  - Split into `requested_at` and `decided_at` fields where decided_at is nullable
  - Use a union type with status-specific semantics

  The name should make it clear what temporal event is being recorded, and the semantics should be consistent
  across
  both
  pending and decided states.
