rationale: |
  The ToolCallRecord lifecycle states are documented in two places with identical text:

  1. In the ToolCallRecord class docstring (lines 104-109):
  ```python
  class ToolCallRecord(BaseModel):
      """Complete tool call record from policy gate (tracks ALL calls through gate).

      States:
      - PENDING: decision=None, execution=None
      - EXECUTING: decision!=None, execution=None
      - COMPLETED: decision!=None, execution!=None
      """
  ```

  2. In the save_tool_call method docstring (lines 167-171):
  ```python
  async def save_tool_call(self, record: ToolCallRecord) -> None:
      """Save or update a tool call record (INSERT OR REPLACE).

      Use this for all lifecycle stages:
      - PENDING: decision=None, execution=None
      - EXECUTING: decision!=None, execution=None
      - COMPLETED: decision!=None, execution!=None
      """
  ```

  This violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. The lifecycle states are a
  property of the ToolCallRecord type itself, not specific to the save_tool_call method.

  Fix: Document the lifecycle states only once in the ToolCallRecord class docstring.
  The save_tool_call method should either:
  - Remove the lifecycle documentation entirely (since it's on the type), or
  - Reference it briefly: "See ToolCallRecord for lifecycle stages"

  This ensures single source of truth and prevents documentation drift.
