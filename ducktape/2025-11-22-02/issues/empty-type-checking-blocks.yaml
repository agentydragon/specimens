rationale: |
  Two files contain TYPE_CHECKING blocks that only contain `pass`, serving no purpose:

  ```python
  if TYPE_CHECKING:
      pass
  ```

  TYPE_CHECKING blocks exist to enable type-only imports that avoid circular dependencies at runtime. A typical
  use
  looks
  like:
  ```python
  if TYPE_CHECKING:
      from module import TypeOnlyNeeded
  ```

  Empty TYPE_CHECKING blocks with only `pass` are dead code - they add noise without providing any
  functionality. They
  may
  have been placeholders that were never filled in, or had imports removed without deleting the block itself.

  **Fix:**
  Delete both empty TYPE_CHECKING blocks:
  - adgn/src/adgn/agent/approvals.py lines 31-32
  - adgn/src/adgn/agent/agent.py lines 43-44

  If type-only imports are needed in the future, they can be added back with actual imports. These empty blocks
  provide
  no
  value.
