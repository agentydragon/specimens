  Lines 60-63 define TOKEN_TABLE with hardcoded mock data: `{"human-token-123": ...,
  "agent-token-abc": ...}`. The comment "In production, this would be a database lookup
  or external service" indicates temporary/mock code.

  The codebase already has a real implementation: TokenMapping class in
  adgn/src/adgn/agent/mcp_bridge/auth.py (lines 24-58) reads token mappings from JSON files
  with proper error handling (FileNotFoundError, ValueError), reload() method, and get_agent_id()
  lookups.

  TOKEN_TABLE should use a similar file-based approach extended to support both human and agent
  tokens with their metadata (role, agent_id). Replace hardcoded mock data with a configuration
  class that parses JSON/YAML into TokenInfo objects using Pydantic. Update tests to use fixture
  files instead of patching the global.

  Could unify with TokenMapping for a single token configuration file serving both purposes.
