    Comments reference historical code states or duplicate log messages/method names.

    Pattern 1 (compositor_factory.py:40, 45): "Mount...engine (now an MCP server)" references historical refactoring state irrelevant after completion.

    Pattern 2 (server.py:209, 237, 361, 363): "Notify that..." comments duplicate what method names/log messages already convey.

    Pattern 3 (server.py:416): Confusing middleware comment with "except... Actually, we want..." contradicts itself instead of stating what it does.

    These comments create maintenance burden and must be updated as code changes. Delete them; log messages and method names are sufficient.
