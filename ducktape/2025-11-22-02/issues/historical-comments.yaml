rationale: |
  Comments reference historical code states or duplicate log messages/method names.

  Pattern 1 (compositor_factory.py:40, 45): "Mount...engine (now an MCP server)" references historical
  refactoring state
  irrelevant after completion.

  Pattern 2 (server.py:209, 237, 361, 363): "Notify that..." comments duplicate what method names/log messages
  already
  convey.

  Pattern 3 (server.py:416): Confusing middleware comment with "except... Actually, we want..." contradicts
  itself
  instead
  of stating what it does.

  These comments create maintenance burden and must be updated as code changes. Delete them; log messages and
  method
  names
  are sufficient.
