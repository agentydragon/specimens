rationale: |
  Several methods in ApprovalHub and ApprovalPolicyEngine are called ONLY by their
  corresponding MCP tools/resources, and nowhere else in production code:

  1. ApprovalHub.resolve() - only called by approve/reject tools (lines 142, 148)
  2. ApprovalPolicyEngine.set_policy() - only called by set_policy tool (lines 316, 322)
  3. ApprovalPolicyEngine.create_proposal() - only called by create_proposal tool (lines 337, 349)
  4. ApprovalPolicyEngine.approve_proposal() - only called by approve_proposal tool (lines 351, 366)
  5. ApprovalPolicyEngine.reject_proposal() - only called by reject_proposal tool (lines 367, 370)

  These are unnecessary abstractions - the methods exist solely to be called by
  their corresponding MCP tool, with no other callers.

  Fix: Inline these methods directly into their MCP tool/resource implementations.

  Example for ApprovalHub.resolve():

  Before:
  def resolve(self, call_id: str, decision: ...) -> None:
      pending = self._pending.pop(call_id, None)
      ...

  @self.tool()
  async def approve(...):
      self.resolve(call_id, decision)

  After:
  @self.tool()
  async def approve(...):
      # Inline resolve logic
      pending = self._pending.pop(call_id, None)
      ...

  Benefits:
  - Removes unnecessary indirection
  - Makes tool implementation self-contained and easier to understand
  - Reduces method count in the class
  - Clearer that this is the ONLY place this logic is used

  Note: Methods like await_decision(), get_policy(), load_policy(), and self_check()
  should NOT be inlined - they're called externally by production code.
