rationale: |
  The `adgn/src/adgn/agent/mcp_bridge/servers/__init__.py` file contains the docstring
  "MCP servers for the MCP bridge." but the servers/ directory contains no actual MCP servers.

  At this commit, the servers/ directory only contains:
  - __init__.py (with misleading docstring)
  - types.py (just type definitions: RunPhase and ApprovalStatus enums)

  The actual MCP server implementation is at `adgn/src/adgn/agent/mcp_bridge/server.py`
  (one level up, not in servers/).

  Additionally, there are two separate types.py files:
  - adgn/src/adgn/agent/mcp_bridge/types.py (parent directory)
  - adgn/src/adgn/agent/mcp_bridge/servers/types.py (servers subdirectory)

  This creates confusion about where types belong and what the servers/ directory is for.

  Fix:
  1. Move servers/types.py to mcp_bridge/types.py or merge with existing mcp_bridge/types.py
  2. Delete the now-empty servers/ directory
  3. Update any imports that reference servers/types.py

  This would eliminate the misleading directory structure and consolidate type definitions
  in one clear location.
