    ApprovalTimeline tests (lines 486, 512, 538, 601) reference WebSocket endpoint `/ws/approvals` that doesn't exist in the backend.

    Backend evidence (app.py:332): WebSocket routes commented out and never registered (`# register_agents_ws(app)`).

    Code comments in stores_channels.ts indicate `/ws/approvals` was intentionally replaced by MCP resource `resource://agents/{agentId}/approvals/pending`.

    Tests are testing against a non-existent, deprecated API that was replaced by MCP resources. Either update tests to use MCP resources or implement the backend endpoint (uncomment register_agents_ws), but current state is broken.
