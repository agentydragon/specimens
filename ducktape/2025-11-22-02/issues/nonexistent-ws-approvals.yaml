rationale: |
  ApprovalTimeline tests (L486, 512, 538, 601) reference `/ws/approvals` endpoint that doesn't
  exist in the backend.

  WebSocket routes are commented out in app.py:332 (`# register_agents_ws(app)`).

  Comments in stores_channels.ts indicate `/ws/approvals` was replaced by MCP resource
  `resource://agents/{agentId}/approvals/pending`.

  Tests are testing a dead API that was replaced by MCP resources. Either update tests to MCP resources,
  or put back/uncomment the ws endpoint, but current state is broken.
