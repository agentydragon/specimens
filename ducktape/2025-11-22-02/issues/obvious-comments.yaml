rationale: |
  Comments state obvious facts that are already clear from method names, types,
  and code structure.

  Examples:
  - "Call persistence to get ACTUAL ID" followed by `policy_id = await self._persistence.set_policy(...)`
  - "Create proposal and get actual database-assigned ID" followed by `proposal_id = await
  self._persistence.create_policy_proposal(...)`
  - "Generate or use provided UI token" followed by `if ui_token is None: ui_token = generate_ui_token()`

  Problems:
  - Obviously calling persistence (visible in code)
  - Obviously getting IDs (clear from method names and return types)
  - Just restates what's visually apparent
  - If clarification is needed, should explain WHY, not WHAT

  Delete these comments. Method names and code structure are sufficient.
