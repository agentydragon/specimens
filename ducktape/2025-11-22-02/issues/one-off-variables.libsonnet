    Multiple unnecessary one-off variables should be inlined. Each variable is assigned once and used exactly once in the next line or expression, adding no value:
    - They're not reused elsewhere
    - They don't improve readability
    - They don't capture intermediate computations that are referenced multiple times
    - They add extra names that readers must track unnecessarily

    **Fix:** Inline each expression directly at its single use site.
