rationale: |
  Two overlapping enums exist: `ApprovalOutcome` (persist/__init__.py:36 with values like `POLICY_ALLOW`,
  `USER_APPROVE`, etc.) and `ApprovalStatus` (approvals.py:70-76 with values `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`,
  etc.). Lines 175-181 define `map_outcome_to_status()` converter that tries `ApprovalStatus(outcome.value)`,
  catches ValueError, and returns `REJECTED` as fallback.

  Converter ALWAYS fails: tries to construct `ApprovalStatus("policy_allow")` which doesn't exist in enum,
  silently returns REJECTED for every input. This causes systematic information loss: `ApprovalOutcome`
  captures WHAT (allow/deny/abort) and WHO (POLICY_/USER_ prefix), but `ApprovalStatus` loses WHO information.
  Can't distinguish "policy auto-approved" from "user explicitly approved after review" - breaks audit trails,
  analytics, debugging, and compliance.

  Use single unified type preserving both outcome and source: either comprehensive enum with `POLICY_APPROVED`,
  `USER_APPROVED`, etc., or separate `Decision(outcome: DecisionOutcome, source: DecisionSource)` model.
  Eliminates need for converters with error-hiding fallbacks.
