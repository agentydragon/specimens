  Confusing "elif live:" inside "if infra:" block (lines 264-267):
  ```python
  if infra:
      # Get pending approvals count
      pending_approvals = len(infra.approval_hub.pending)

      # Derive run phase
      if pending_approvals > 0:
          run_phase = RunPhase.WAITING_APPROVAL
      elif live:  # <-- CONFUSING!
          run_phase = RunPhase.SAMPLING
  ```

  The `elif live:` appears inside `if infra:`, but `live = infra is not None`.
  If we're inside the `if infra:` block, then `live` is always True, making the
  elif test redundant and confusing.

  Should flatten the logic:
  ```python
  if not infra:
      run_phase = RunPhase.IDLE
      pending_approvals = 0
  elif (pending_approvals := len(infra.approval_hub.pending)) > 0:
      run_phase = RunPhase.WAITING_APPROVAL
  else:
      run_phase = RunPhase.SAMPLING
  ```
