rationale: |
  Lines 264-267 have confusing "elif live:" inside "if infra:" block. The `live` variable equals `infra is not
  None`, so inside the `if infra:` block, `live` is always True, making the elif test redundant and confusing.

  Should flatten the logic:
  ```python
  if not infra:
      run_phase = RunPhase.IDLE
      pending_approvals = 0
  elif (pending_approvals := len(infra.approval_hub.pending)) > 0:
      run_phase = RunPhase.WAITING_APPROVAL
  else:
      run_phase = RunPhase.SAMPLING
  ```
