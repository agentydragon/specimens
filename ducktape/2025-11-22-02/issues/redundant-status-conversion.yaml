rationale: |
  Both resource handlers convert p.status and got.status to ProposalStatus:

  Line 388: status=ProposalStatus(p.status)
  Line 405: status=ProposalStatus(got.status)

  This conversion is necessarily redundant:

  Case 1: If p.status and got.status are already ProposalStatus, then
  ProposalStatus(p.status) is a no-op that should be p.status directly.

  Case 2: If p.status is a different type (e.g., string or database enum),
  this indicates a type inconsistency that should be fixed upstream.

  Similar to finding 024 (ApprovalOutcome vs ApprovalStatus), this suggests
  ProposalStatus might have a duplicate in the persistence layer, requiring
  conversion at the boundary.

  Fix options:
  1. If already ProposalStatus: remove conversion, use status=p.status
  2. If persistence returns different type: unify types - make persistence
     return ProposalStatus directly, OR move conversion into persistence
     layer's model so it returns objects with ProposalStatus already set
  3. Most likely: duplicate enums that should be unified

  This is a type correctness issue - types should match at boundaries
  without runtime conversion.
