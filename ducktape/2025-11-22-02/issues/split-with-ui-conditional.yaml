rationale: |
  Lines 70-72 and 84-86 split with_ui conditional logic unnecessarily. First
  block creates ui_bus and connection_manager, then builder.start() executes,
  then second block attaches UI sidecar. These operations are independent and
  could be consolidated.

  **Problem:** Split conditional increases cognitive load and makes control flow
  harder to follow. The two if with_ui blocks could be merged, or consolidated
  entirely by moving ConnectionManager construction inline and creating ui_bus
  only when needed.

  **Fix:** Consolidate into single block after builder.start() by using inline
  conditional for connection_manager and creating ui_bus only in the final if
  block. Eliminates split conditional.
