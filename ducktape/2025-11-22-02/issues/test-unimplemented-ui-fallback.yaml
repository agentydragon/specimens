  Lines 44-55 and 288-298 in test_mcp_errors.py check for unimplemented UI error elements
  (.error, .alert-error, [data-testid='error-message']) with fallback logic that accepts
  completely different behaviors (WS connection status).

  Three problems: tests unimplemented features (backend no longer implements those error UI
  elements); swallows all errors with bare `except Exception:` hiding actual test failures;
  accepts contradictory outcomes (either error indicators appear OR WS disconnects - having
  both as acceptable makes tests meaningless, they pass regardless of what happens).

  Tests should NOT have fallback logic accepting massively different behaviors. Pick ONE
  expected behavior per test and assert it happens. Remove tests for unimplemented UI features
  or implement the features first. Remove error-swallowing exception handlers. If testing error
  states, verify the specific error indicator that actually exists.
