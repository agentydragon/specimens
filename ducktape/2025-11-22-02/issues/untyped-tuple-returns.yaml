  Lines 188-189 define policy persistence methods with unclear return types:
  `get_latest_policy` returns `tuple[str, int] | None` where tuple unpacking
  requires remembering the order and the int's meaning (policy ID) is non-obvious.
  `set_policy` returns an undocumented int (the database-assigned policy ID).

  Problems: Tuple unpacking requires remembering element order, no semantic meaning
  to tuple positions, unclear what the int represents, requires checking None before
  unpacking, callers must know implementation details.

  Replace with a typed object (PolicyRecord or NamedTuple) containing id, content,
  timestamp, and agent_id fields. This provides self-documenting field names,
  type safety, IDE autocomplete, and clear semantics. Alternatively, at minimum
  add docstring documenting what the int represents.
