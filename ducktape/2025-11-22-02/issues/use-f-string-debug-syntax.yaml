  Python 3.8+ supports f"{variable=}" syntax which is more concise than f"variable={variable}":

  auth.py line 99:
  ```python
  logger.debug(f"Authenticated request: token → agent_id={agent_id}")
  ```

  server.py line 122:
  ```python
  logger.info(f"Infrastructure ready for agent_id={agent_id}")
  ```

  Both can be shortened using the = suffix in f-strings.

  Use f"{variable=}" syntax:

  auth.py:
  ```python
  logger.debug(f"Authenticated request: token → {agent_id=}")
  ```

  server.py:
  ```python
  logger.info(f"Infrastructure ready for {agent_id=}")
  ```

  This is more concise and makes it clear we're debugging/logging a variable's value.
