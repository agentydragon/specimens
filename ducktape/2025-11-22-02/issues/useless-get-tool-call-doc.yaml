rationale: |
  The get_tool_call method has a docstring that provides zero value beyond what's
  already obvious from the method signature:

  ```python
  async def get_tool_call(self, call_id: str) -> ToolCallRecord | None:
      """Get a tool call record by call_id."""
  ```

  The docstring merely restates: method name, parameter name and return type.
  This is a textbook example of useless documentation that should be removed.
  Good documentation explains WHY or HOW, not WHAT (which is already clear from
  the signature).

  Remove the docstring, the method signature is self-documenting.
