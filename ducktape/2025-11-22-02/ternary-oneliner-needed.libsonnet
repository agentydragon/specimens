    The policy_source initialization uses two lines when it could be a single ternary expression:

    ```python
    policy_source = None
    if initial_policy:
        policy_source = initial_policy.read_text()
    ```

    This is a simple conditional assignment - perfect for a ternary operator.

    Replace with ternary oneliner:

    ```python
    policy_source = initial_policy.read_text() if initial_policy else None
    ```

    Benefits:
    - More concise (one line vs three)
    - Standard Python idiom for conditional assignment
    - Clearer intent (assigning based on condition)
    - Variable is const-assigned (not mutated)
