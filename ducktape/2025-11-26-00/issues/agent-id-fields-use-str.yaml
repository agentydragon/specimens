rationale: |
  Multiple fields that semantically represent agent IDs use generic str type instead
  of the AgentID newtype from adgn.agent.types.

  **Two occurrences in agents_ws.py:**

  **1. AgentBrief.id (line 30)**
  Field defined as `id: str` but semantically represents an agent ID.

  **2. AgentStatusData.id (line 66)**
  Field defined as `id: str` but semantically represents an agent ID.

  **Problem with using str for typed IDs:**
  - Loss of type safety (can pass any string)
  - No semantic clarity (doesn't indicate this is specifically an agent ID)
  - Can't enforce ID format constraints
  - Harder to track ID flow through codebase

  **Correct approach: Use AgentID newtype**

  Replace `id: str` with `id: AgentID` and ensure AgentID is imported from
  adgn.agent.types. Pydantic handles NewType aliases correctly for validation and
  serialization.

  Benefits:
  - Type checker catches misuse (passing non-agent-ID strings)
  - Clear semantic meaning (this is specifically an agent ID)
  - Can grep for AgentID to find all agent ID usage
  - Consistent with codebase typing conventions
