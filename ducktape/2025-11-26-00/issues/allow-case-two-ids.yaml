rationale: |
  Lines 164-168 mint TWO different random IDs for the SAME tool call, making correlation
  between persistence records and in-flight tracking impossible.

  **The problem:**
  Line 164 creates ID #1 ("pg:" + uuid) for persistence record.
  Line 167 creates ID #2 (bare uuid) for _inflight tracking.
  Line 225 removes using ID #2, breaking the correlation chain.

  Cannot track: persistence → in-flight → completion under a single ID.
  Also inconsistent prefix usage ("pg:" vs bare).

  **Contrast with ASK case (line 238):** Mints call_id ONCE, then uses it consistently
  for ApprovalHub, notifications, and persistence (lines 254, 262).

  **Fix:** Mint call_id once after policy decision, before branching. All paths (ALLOW,
  DENY_ABORT, DENY_CONTINUE, ASK) use the same ID for persistence, tracking, and cleanup.
  This eliminates duplication and ensures consistent prefix usage.
