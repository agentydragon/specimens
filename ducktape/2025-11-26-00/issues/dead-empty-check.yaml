rationale: |
  Lines 185-186 check `if not batch.resources: return None`. This is dead code
  because `batch.resources` is a dict, and the next check (lines 189-193) already
  filters for servers with actual updates, returning None if the filtered dict is
  empty.

  The behavior is identical whether `batch.resources` is an empty dict or just
  doesn't have any entries with updates. The early return for empty dict adds no value.

  **Fix:** Delete lines 185-186. The filtering logic already handles the "no updates" case.
