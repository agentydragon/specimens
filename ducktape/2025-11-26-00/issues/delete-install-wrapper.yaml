  Lines 279-298 define `install_policy_gateway()` which is just a wrapper around
  constructor + `add_middleware()`. This is unnecessary indirection.

  **Current pattern:**
  `install_policy_gateway(comp, hub=..., policy_reader=..., ...)` creates a
  `PolicyGatewayMiddleware` instance, calls `comp.add_middleware(middleware)`, and
  returns the middleware.

  **Problem:** This is just a wrapper around `middleware = PolicyGatewayMiddleware(...);
  comp.add_middleware(middleware)`. Callers can do this themselves in 2 lines.

  **Fix:** Delete the function. Callers should do:
  ```python
  middleware = PolicyGatewayMiddleware(hub=hub, policy_reader=policy_reader, ...)
  comp.add_middleware(middleware)
  ```

  **Benefits:**
  1. Fewer functions to maintain
  2. Clearer what's happening - no magic wrapper
  3. Standard pattern (create middleware, add it)
  4. No confusing mutable-state wrapper around compositor

  **Docstring claim:** "This mirrors production wiring in the container; tests should
  reuse this helper to avoid drift." This is not a good reason - tests should just
  use the same 2-line pattern as production. The "drift" risk is minimal and the
  indirection cost is higher.
