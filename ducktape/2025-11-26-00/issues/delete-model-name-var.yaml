  Lines 743-744 extract `model_name` from config with a comment saying "Model parsing
  handled by AppConfig.resolve". Both the variable and comment are unnecessary.

  **Current:**
  ```python
  # Model parsing handled by AppConfig.resolve
  model_name = config.model_name

  # Later used at:
  key = build_cache_key(model_name, ...)  # line 752-753
  ProduceMessageInput(..., model_name=model_name, ...)  # line 759
  ```

  **Problems:**
  1. `model_name` is used only twice, both could use `config.model_name` directly
  2. Comment is useless - it's obvious that AppConfig.resolve handles parsing
  3. Extra variable to track for no benefit

  **Fix:**
  - Delete lines 743-744
  - Line 753: Use `config.model_name` instead of `model_name`
  - Line 759: Use `config.model_name` instead of `model_name`

  **Benefits:**
  1. Fewer variables
  2. Clear where value comes from (config)
  3. No useless comment
