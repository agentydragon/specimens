    Lines 105-115 return fabricated string `"unknown"` when no server matches
    the URI. This fails silently: callers might not handle it specially, it
    could be used as an actual server name downstream, and bugs become harder
    to track (error happens far from source).

    Fix: raise `ValueError` with clear message including the URI and available
    servers. This fails fast and loud, provides context, and forces callers
    to handle the error case properly.
