rationale: |
  Lines 105-115 return fabricated string `"unknown"` when no server matches
  the URI. This fails silently: callers might not handle it specially, it
  could be used as an actual server name downstream, and bugs become harder
  to track (error happens far from source).

  Fix: raise `ValueError` with clear message including the URI and available
  servers. This fails fast and loud, provides context, and forces callers
  to handle the error case properly.
