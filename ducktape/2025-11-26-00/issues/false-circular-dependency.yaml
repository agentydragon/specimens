rationale: |
  Lines 179-182 have inline imports with comment claiming "circular dependency with registry setup", but no
  circular
  dependency exists. Investigation shows mcp_bridge modules do NOT import from app.py.

  Move imports to top of file (standard import organization), delete misleading comment, remove noqa PLC0415
  suppressions.
  If a circular dependency actually existed, the correct fix would be architecture refactoring, not hidden
  inline
  imports.
