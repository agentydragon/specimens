  Lines 220-226 in runtime.py use an imperative for-loop with `.append()` to build
  a list, when a list comprehension would be more Pythonic. Additionally, it has
  redundant type conversions and a useless comment.

  **Problems:**
  1. Imperative loop instead of comprehension (non-idiomatic Python)
  2. Useless comment - "Strict mapping; surface invalid data" doesn't explain anything
     since ProposalStatus enum constructor already raises ValueError on invalid data
     (standard enum behavior)
  3. Redundant `str()` conversions - both `r.id` and `r.status` are already `str`
     (PolicyProposal has `id: str`, `status: str`)
  4. `rows` variable used only once

  **Fix:**
  Replace with list comprehension:
  `proposals = [ProposalInfo(id=r.id, status=ProposalStatus(r.status)) for r in rows]`
  or inline `rows` if the method call isn't too long.

  This is more Pythonic, eliminates redundant conversions, removes the useless comment,
  and clearly expresses the data transformation.
