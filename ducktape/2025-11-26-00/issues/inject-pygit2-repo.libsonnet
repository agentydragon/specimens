    Lines 161-164 discover and create a pygit2 repository inside
    `generate_commit_message_minicodex()`, violating dependency injection.
    The function creates its own dependencies instead of receiving them.

    Problems: harder to test (can't inject test repository), duplicates
    discovery logic (caller at cli.py:704 already has repo), tight coupling
    to current working directory.

    Fix: accept `repo: pygit2.Repository` parameter and pass it through from
    the caller. The MCP server created internally should also use the injected
    repository instead of discovering its own.
