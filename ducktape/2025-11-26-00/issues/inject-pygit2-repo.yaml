  Lines 161-164 discover and create a pygit2 repository inside
  `generate_commit_message_minicodex()`, violating dependency injection.
  The function creates its own dependencies instead of receiving them.

  Problems: harder to test (can't inject test repository), duplicates
  discovery logic (caller at cli.py:704 already has repo), tight coupling
  to current working directory.

  Fix: accept `repo: pygit2.Repository` parameter and pass it through from
  the caller. The MCP server created internally should also use the injected
  repository instead of discovering its own.
