rationale: |
  Line 197 in container.py types `_policy_gateway` as `Any | None` with a comment
  indicating it should be `PolicyGatewayMiddleware`, but doesn't use the proper type.

  **Problems:**
  1. Loss of type safety - `Any` defeats type checking
  2. Misleading comment - if we know the type, use it in the annotation
  3. IDE limitations - no autocomplete or type hints when using this field
  4. Maintenance burden - comment can drift from reality

  **Fix:** Import `PolicyGatewayMiddleware` from `adgn.mcp.policy_gateway.middleware`
  and change the type annotation to `PolicyGatewayMiddleware | None`. Remove the comment.

  This enables proper type checking, IDE support, and makes the code self-documenting.
