  Lines 62-72 define `poll()` and `peek()` which both call `_build_resources()` and
  create `NotificationsBatch` objects independently. This duplicates the batch creation
  logic.

  **The issue:** Both methods build resources and construct batch objects separately,
  obscuring that `poll()` is conceptually `peek()` plus clear operations.

  **Fix:** Make `poll()` call `peek()`, then clear buffers. This DRYs batch creation
  into one place and makes the relationship explicit: poll = peek + clear.

  If `_build_resources()` becomes single-use after this change, inline it into `peek()`.
