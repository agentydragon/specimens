  Line 293 converts `rec.status` to `ProposalStatus` enum, suggesting the persistence
  layer and application layer use different types for the same concept.

  **The issue:** `PolicyProposal.status` (persist/__init__.py) is typed as `str`, not
  `ProposalStatus`. Line 293 must convert at the application boundary. This creates drift
  risk: invalid status strings in the database won't be caught by the type system, and
  runtime errors occur if the database contains unexpected values.

  **Fix:** Change `PolicyProposal.status` from `str` to `ProposalStatus` enum. Pydantic
  validates on construction. No conversion needed at line 293 - persistence layer enforces
  the enum, application layer receives typed values.

  Benefits: single source of truth, type safety throughout stack, no runtime conversion
  errors.
