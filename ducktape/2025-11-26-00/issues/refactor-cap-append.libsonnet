  rationale: 'Lines 18-29 define `_cap_append()` which mutates parts list and handles truncation. Forces callers (lines 133-149) to think about truncation at each append.\n\nProblems: (1) caller must know when to use `_cap_append()` vs `parts.append()`, (2) truncation interleaved with data collection, (3) same cap/note constants repeated 4 times at call sites, (4) function mutates list and returns boolean, (5) magic constants duplicated instead of centralized.\n\nReplace with `join_with_truncation(parts, max_chars, note)` that takes complete list and truncates once at end. Callers build full list using plain `append()`, then call `join_with_truncation()` once. Define constants at module level, not repeated at call sites. Benefits: separation of concerns, pure function, constants defined once, easy to change behavior in one place.\n',
