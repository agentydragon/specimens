rationale: |
  Lines 29-30 contain useless comments documenting historical implementation details.

  The comments explain that gateway_client parameter is "no longer used" and describe
  internal implementation changes. Historical notes and internal implementation rationale
  don't help readers understand current behavior. Delete them.
