  Lines 230-232 in runtime.py use an imperative if-statement to conditionally assign
  `details`, when a ternary expression would be clearer and more concise.

  **Current pattern:**
  ```
  details = None
  if (condition):
      details = SnapshotDetails(...)
  ```

  **Better:** Use ternary operator for conditional assignment:
  ```
  details = SnapshotDetails(...) if condition else None
  ```

  This is more concise and clearly expresses that `details` is conditionally assigned
  based on a single condition.
