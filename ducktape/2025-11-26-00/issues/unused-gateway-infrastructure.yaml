rationale: |
  Unused gateway-related infrastructure that should be deleted.

  **1. Test stub classes and variables never used after definition**

  - test_list_changes_subscriptions.py: stub classes (12-22), `gw = _StubGatewayClient()`
    instantiated at lines 30, 53 but never referenced
  - test_subscriptions_index.py: stub classes (14-28), `gw = _StubGatewayClient()` at
    line 51 never referenced
  - test_resources_subscriptions_index.py: stub classes (14-28) defined but never
    instantiated; also `async with Client(comp) as gw:` at line 52 creates unused gw

  **2. Unused context manager (test_notifications.py:29-31)**

  Creates `gw_server = FastMCP("gw")` and `async with Client(gw_server) as gw:` but
  gw is never used.

  **3. Unused parameter (setup.py:21)**

  `gateway_client` parameter checked with `if gateway_client is not None` but value
  never passed to anything. Comment on line 29 even says "gateway_client parameter is
  no longer used".

  Delete all unused stubs, variables, and the dead parameter.
