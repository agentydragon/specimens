"""
System message for the MiniCodex HTML interface (Python module).

Intent
- Provide a single source of truth for system instructions used when the HTML UI
  boots an agent (no persistence or runtime user edits yet; pure constants).
- Keep this short, actionable, and tailored for the web-chat workflow.

If future toggles (markdown on/off, etc.) are needed, add optional params
but keep the default equal to the UI's typical behavior.
