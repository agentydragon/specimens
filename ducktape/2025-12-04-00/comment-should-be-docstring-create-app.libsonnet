    Line 40 in server/app.py contains a comment above the create_app function:
    "# Factory to create an isolated app with fresh manager/session"

    This should be the function's docstring instead of a comment. Comments above
    function definitions that describe the function's purpose should always be
    docstrings for several reasons:

    1. Docstrings are accessible via help() and IDE introspection
    2. Docstrings are the standard Python convention for documenting functions
    3. Tools like Sphinx can extract docstrings for documentation generation
    4. Type checkers and linters understand docstrings

    The comment should be converted to:

    def create_app(*, require_static_assets: bool = True) -> FastAPI:
        """Factory to create an isolated app with fresh manager/session."""
        app = FastAPI()
        ...
