rationale: |
  Variables abbreviated to save characters without achieving any meaningful line length savings. Full
  descriptive names
  improve readability at negligible cost.

  Specific instances:
  - cid → call_id (used throughout agent.py)
  - ocid → original_call_id (lines 555-563)

  The abbreviations save 5-6 characters but don't prevent any line wrapping, so they only reduce clarity.
