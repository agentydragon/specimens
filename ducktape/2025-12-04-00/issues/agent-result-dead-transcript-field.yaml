rationale: |
  `AgentResult.transcript` (lines 28-32) is always an empty list. The `transcript`
  variable is initialized to [] at line 45, never appended to, and returned still
  empty at line 65. Callers only access `res.final_text` (lines 153-156).

  The TranscriptHandler writes to a file, not to a returned collection - there's
  no mechanism to populate this field.

  Fix: Remove the dead `transcript` field from AgentResult.
