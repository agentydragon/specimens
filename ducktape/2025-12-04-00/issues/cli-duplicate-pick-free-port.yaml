  _pick_free_port() in agent/cli.py reimplements port-finding logic that closely matches
  pick_free_port() in util/net.py. The CLI version adds a "preferred port" feature (scan
  from a starting port). Either the CLI should use the shared utility, or the CLI's
  version should be moved to util/net.py for reuse.
