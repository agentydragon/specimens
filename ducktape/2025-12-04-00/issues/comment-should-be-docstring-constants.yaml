rationale: |
  Line 1 in mcp/_shared/constants.py has a comment that should be a module docstring:
  "# Shared constants for MCP mcp/_shared modules"

  Current code:

  # Shared constants for MCP mcp/_shared modules

  from pathlib import Path
  from typing import Final

  Problems:

  1. **Wrong documentation style**: Module-level documentation should use docstrings
     (triple-quoted strings), not comments. Docstrings are:
     - Accessible via `__doc__` attribute
     - Shown by `help()` function
     - Extracted by documentation tools (Sphinx, pdoc)
     - Standard Python convention (PEP 257)

  2. **Not discoverable**: Comments at the top of files are not accessible
     programmatically or by documentation tools. This makes the module's purpose
     invisible to introspection and automated documentation.

  3. **Inconsistent with Python conventions**: PEP 257 specifies that module
     docstrings should be the first statement in a file (after any shebang/encoding).

  Suggested fix:

  """Shared constants for MCP _shared modules."""

  from pathlib import Path
  from typing import Final

  After refactoring:

  - Module purpose is accessible via `constants.__doc__`
  - `help(constants)` shows the description
  - Documentation tools can extract and display it
  - Follows Python conventions (PEP 257)
  - More maintainable and discoverable

  This is a common anti-pattern where developers use comments for module/class/function
  documentation instead of docstrings. Always prefer docstrings for documentation that
  describes what something IS or DOES.
