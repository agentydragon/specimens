rationale: |
  The file `src/adgn/mcp/exec/docker/server.py` contains only `make_container_exec_server`, which is the sole
  user of
  `register_container` from container_session.py. This creates unnecessary indirection and file fragmentation:
  - The entire file is 36 lines for one thin wrapper function
  - `make_container_exec_server` just calls `EnhancedFastMCP()`, `make_container_lifespan()`,
  and `register_container()`
  - `register_container` is only called from this one place

  Either merge the functionality into container_session.py (making `register_container` the primary entry point)
  or find
  another justification for this separation. The current structure adds no value and makes the codebase harder
  to
  navigate.
