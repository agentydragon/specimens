rationale: |
  The function `derive_run_phase` (lines 25-36) is defined but never called. It was replaced by
  `determine_run_phase`
  (lines 37+) which provides more precise run phase determination by considering both pending approvals AND MCP
  inflight
  status.

  The old function only checked pending approvals, returning either IDLE or WAITING_APPROVAL. The new function
  adds
  proper
  IDLE detection (no pending approvals AND no MCP inflight).

  Since the old function is completely unused and superseded, it should be deleted.
