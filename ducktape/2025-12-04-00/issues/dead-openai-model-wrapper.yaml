rationale: |
  The `OpenAIModel` adapter defined in `adgn/src/adgn/openai_utils/model.py` (lines ~345-379) is dead code. All
  production call sites build `BoundOpenAIModel` via `client_factory.build_client`, and tests use their own
  `FakeOpenAIModel`/`CapturingOpenAIModel` doubles that implement `OpenAIModelProto`. No code instantiates or
  references `OpenAIModel`, and `rg "OpenAIModel("` shows only the class definition itself.

  Keeping an unused adapter increases maintenance surface and risks divergence from the bound wrapper. It should
  be deleted to simplify the module and avoid confusion about which adapter is active.
