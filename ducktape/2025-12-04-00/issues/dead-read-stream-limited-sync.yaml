  The function `read_stream_limited_sync()` at lines 241-264 is dead code that is never called anywhere in the
  codebase.
  A
  ripgrep search across the entire project shows only the function definition itself, with no call sites.

  The async variant `read_stream_limited_async()` (lines 266+) is actively used in `seatbelt.py` for reading
  subprocess
  stdout/stderr streams. The sync version appears to be leftover or speculative code that was never integrated
  into any
  actual execution paths.

  Docker exec implementations (`_run_session_container` and `_run_ephemeral_container`) use different approaches
  (custom
  stream reading from `exec_obj.start()` and `container.log()` API respectively), not the generic stream reader
  functions.

  This function should be removed.
