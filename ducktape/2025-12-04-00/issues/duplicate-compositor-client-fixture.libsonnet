    The `compositor_client` fixture is defined identically in two separate conftest.py
    files, violating DRY principle:

    1. tests/mcp/conftest.py:47-50
    2. tests/agent/conftest.py:49-52

    Both have identical implementation (only docstring differs slightly):

    ```python
    @pytest.fixture
    async def compositor_client(compositor):
        """Client connected to the compositor."""
        async with Client(compositor) as client:
            yield client
    ```

    This creates potential issues:
    - Fixture shadowing/conflicts when tests import from both scopes
    - Maintenance burden: changes must be duplicated in both places
    - Inconsistent docstrings ("compositor" vs "compositor fixture")

    Resolution: Consolidate into a single shared fixture in the common conftest.py
    (likely tests/conftest.py at the root level, or keep in tests/mcp/conftest.py
    since MCP tests are the primary consumer and agent tests can import from there).
