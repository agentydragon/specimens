rationale: |
  The function `_configure_logging_info` is duplicated in two files. While slightly different in implementation
  (cli.py
  has a longer version that also sets handler level to INFO, matrix_bot.py just calls configure_logging), they
  serve the
  same purpose: configure INFO-level logging before running commands.

  The cli.py version (lines 91-96) explicitly sets StreamHandler level to INFO after calling configure_logging.
  The
  matrix_bot.py version (lines 35-36) just calls configure_logging.

  These should be unified into a single shared implementation, likely in a common logging configuration module.
