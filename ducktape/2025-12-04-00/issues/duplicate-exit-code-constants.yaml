rationale: |
  Exit code constants (SIGNAL_EXIT_OFFSET, signal_exit_code(), EXIT_CODE_SIGTERM,
  EXIT_CODE_SIGKILL) are duplicated in both _shared/constants.py and exec/models.py
  with identical definitions.

  This creates a maintenance burden and risks divergence. Since these constants are
  tightly coupled to the exec implementation and primarily used there, they should
  be defined in exec/models.py only.

  Resolution: Remove the duplicates from _shared/constants.py and update
  container_session.py to import from exec/models.py instead.
