  The function `_filter_files` is duplicated nearly identically in two CLI command files. Both implementations:
  - Take the same parameters: `all_files: Mapping[Path, object], requested_files: list[str] | None`
  - Return the same type: `FileScopeSpec`
  - Have identical logic for validation and filtering
  - Only differ in one docstring word: "specimen" vs "snapshot"

  This 20+ line function should be extracted to a shared CLI utilities module (e.g.,
  `adgn/src/adgn/props/cli_app/shared.py` or similar) and imported in both command files.
