rationale: |
  `ModelMetadata` (line 409) and `ModelPricing` (line 456) are duplicate database models with identical schemas.
  Both
  store the same fields:
  - model_id (primary key)
  - input_usd_per_1m_tokens
  - cached_input_usd_per_1m_tokens
  - output_usd_per_1m_tokens
  - context_window_tokens
  - max_output_tokens
  - updated_at

  Both sync from the same source (`adgn.openai_utils.model_metadata.MODEL_METADATA`) and serve the same purpose
  (OpenAI
  model pricing/limits for cost calculation).

  The code inconsistently uses different models for different layers:
  - `ModelMetadata` (table: model_metadata) is used by sync_model_metadata.py and CLI commands (cmd_db.py)
  - `ModelPricing` (table: model_pricing) is used by the run_costs view creation (create_run_costs_view at
  lines 527,
  545)

  This parallel implementation creates maintenance burden: any schema changes must be applied to both models,
  both
  tables
  must be synced, and queries must choose arbitrarily between them. Merge into a single model (keep
  `ModelMetadata` as
  it's more semantically accurate - it includes context limits, not just pricing).
