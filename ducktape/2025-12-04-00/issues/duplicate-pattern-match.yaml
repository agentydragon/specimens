  The expression "any(matches_pattern(f, pattern) for pattern in <list>)" appears
  twice in apply_gitignore_patterns (lines 38 and 42). This should be extracted to
  a local helper function to eliminate duplication and improve readability. The helper
  could be named something like matches_any_pattern(path, patterns).
