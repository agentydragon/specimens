  Line 27 in transcript_handler.py contains a false comment: "The parent directory must already exist
  (created by run managers)." This is contradicted by lines 36-37 which explicitly create the parent
  directory with `mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`. The comment should be removed as it's inaccurate.
