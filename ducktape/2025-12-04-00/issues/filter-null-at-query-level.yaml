  Lines 132-138 in cluster_unknowns.py load ALL GraderRun and Critique records from the database, then filter
  out NULL
  outputs in Python code later (inside _extract_unknowns_from_run at lines 62-63).

  This is inefficient because we're loading potentially many rows with NULL outputs from the database, only to
  discard
  them immediately. The filtering should happen at the SQL query level using WHERE clauses, similar to how other
  CLI
  commands (e.g., the stats subcommand) filter NULL outputs in their queries.

  The query (line 136) should add filters for:
  - `GraderRun.output.is_not(None)`
  - `Critique.payload.is_not(None)` (if applicable)

  This avoids loading and processing rows that will be discarded, improving performance especially with large
  datasets.
