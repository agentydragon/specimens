rationale: |
  The _extract_commit_content function in git_commit_ai incorrectly strips all blank lines from commit messages,
  not just comment lines. The condition `if line.strip() and not line.strip().startswith("#")` filters out any
  line that is empty or contains only whitespace.

  This breaks the standard git commit message format where the subject line should be separated from the body
  by a blank line. A commit message like:

    Fix the bug

    This is the body explaining the fix.

  becomes:

    Fix the bug
    This is the body explaining the fix.

  The fix is to change the condition to `if not line.strip().startswith("#")` so that blank lines are preserved
  while still filtering out comment lines starting with #.
