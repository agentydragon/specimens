rationale: |
  The git_ro formatting module loses path information when handling renamed files. For renamed files, both
  old_file.path
  and new_file.path are available from pygit2, but the code collapses this to a single path field, losing the
  rename
  information.

  This affects both ChangedFileItem (lines 113-116) and StatItem (lines 158-161). The pattern `(d.new_file.path
  or
  d.old_file.path) if d.new_file else d.old_file.path` selects one path but discards the other, making it
  impossible for
  callers to determine the source and destination of a rename operation.

  The proper solution is to preserve both paths in the model and let callers interpret them based on the status
  field.
