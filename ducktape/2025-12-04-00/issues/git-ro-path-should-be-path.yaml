  The git_ro formatting module uses str for path fields instead of pathlib.Path. Using Path objects provides
  better type
  safety and enables path manipulation methods. Per project conventions, paths should be represented as Path
  objects and
  only converted to str at I/O boundaries.

  This affects StatusEntry (line 66), ChangedFileItem (line 88), and StatItem (line 131).
