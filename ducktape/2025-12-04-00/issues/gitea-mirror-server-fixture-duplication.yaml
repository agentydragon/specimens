  The test file has duplicate initialization of `GiteaMirrorServer` with identical arguments at lines 70 and 97:

  ```python
  mirror_server = server.make_gitea_mirror_server(
      base_url="https://gitea.local",
      token="secret-token"
  )
  ```

  This pattern appears in multiple test functions with the same test credentials. Should be extracted into a
  shared
  pytest
  fixture (e.g., `gitea_mirror_server`) in conftest.py to:
  - Eliminate duplication
  - Centralize test configuration
  - Make it easier to update test credentials in one place
  - Follow DRY principle for test fixtures

  The fixture should return the initialized server instance, allowing tests to use it directly via dependency
  injection
  rather than creating it inline.
