rationale: |
  FastMCP enhancement modules are inconsistently placed: `notifying_fastmcp.py` lives at the top level of
  `src/adgn/mcp/`,
  while `fastmcp_flat.py` lives under `src/adgn/mcp/_shared/`.

  This creates confusion about where FastMCP enhancements should be located. The `_shared/` directory is unclear
  in
  purpose and splits related functionality. Developers must search multiple locations to understand the full set
  of
  FastMCP enhancements available.

  All FastMCP enhancements should be co-located in a single namespace (e.g., `src/adgn/mcp/enhanced/`) for
  clarity and
  discoverability.
