  Conditional at lines 169-190 nests the complex branch inside an if, making the code harder to follow.
  The mount.proxy is None case (line 190) is simple and should be handled with early bailout:
  - Check if mount.proxy is None, set InitializingServerEntry, continue to next mount
  - Remove the else branch and un-indent the complex logic
  This reduces nesting depth by one level for the main logic path.
