rationale: |
  Function extract_structured_content accepts both FMCallToolResult and mcp_types.CallToolResult, making type
  reasoning
  harder.
  This loose typing forces runtime normalization and isinstance checks throughout the function.
  The function should accept only mcp_types.CallToolResult, and callers should explicitly convert using
  fastmcp_to_mcp_result if needed.
  This pushes the conversion to the boundary, making the core logic simpler and type-safe.
