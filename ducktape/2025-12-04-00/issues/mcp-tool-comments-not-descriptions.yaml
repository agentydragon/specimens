rationale: |
  MCP tool input model fields have comments containing agent-useful information, but these comments are
  invisible to the
  MCP client. SandboxExecArgs is an MCP tool input model (used by sandbox_exec tool on line 93), so field
  documentation
  that helps agents understand usage should be in Field(description="...") rather than comments.

  This matters because:
  1. Field descriptions are included in the JSON Schema sent to MCP clients
  2. LLM agents see Field descriptions when planning tool calls
  3. Comments are invisible to the MCP protocol and don't help the agent understand usage
