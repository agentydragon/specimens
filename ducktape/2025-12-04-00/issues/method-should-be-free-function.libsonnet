    Method _fm_transport_from_spec at lines 343-352 is an instance method but accesses no instance state.
    It's a pure transformation function: MCPServerTypes → ClientTransport.
    This should be a module-level function outside the class, not a method.
    As a free function, it's easier to test in isolation and signals that it has no side effects or class dependencies.
