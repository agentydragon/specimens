  Method _fm_transport_from_spec at lines 343-352 is an instance method but accesses no instance state.
  It's a pure transformation function: MCPServerTypes → ClientTransport.
  This should be a module-level function outside the class, not a method.
  As a free function, it's easier to test in isolation and signals that it has no side effects or class
  dependencies.
