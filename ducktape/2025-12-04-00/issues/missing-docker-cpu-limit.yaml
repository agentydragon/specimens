rationale: |
  Docker containers created by ContainerOptions and _build_host_config() do not
  specify CPU limits. While the containers are otherwise well-isolated, it would be
  healthy to set explicit CPU constraints to prevent a single container from
  monopolizing CPU resources.

  Setting CPU limits helps:
  - Ensure fair resource sharing when multiple containers run concurrently
  - Make performance characteristics more predictable
  - Prevent accidental CPU exhaustion from runaway processes

  Docker supports NanoCpus (fractional CPUs, e.g., 1.5 CPUs = 1500000000 nanocpus)
  and CpuQuota/CpuPeriod in HostConfig. A reasonable default could be 2 CPUs for
  agent runtime containers and 1 CPU for critics/graders.

  Example addition to _build_host_config():
    host_config["NanoCpus"] = opts.nano_cpus or (2 * 1_000_000_000)  # 2 CPUs default
