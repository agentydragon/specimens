rationale: |
  Docker containers created by ContainerOptions and _build_host_config() do not
  specify memory limits. While containers are isolated by network mode ("none") and
  read-only volumes, it would be healthier to set explicit memory constraints.

  Setting memory limits helps:
  - Prevent runaway processes from affecting host stability
  - Make resource usage predictable and debuggable
  - Align with containerization best practices

  Docker supports Memory (hard limit) and MemoryReservation (soft limit) in HostConfig.
  A reasonable default could be 2-4GB for agent runtime containers and 1-2GB for
  critics/graders, with the option to override per use case.

  Example addition to _build_host_config():
    host_config["Memory"] = opts.mem_limit or (2 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024)  # 2GB default
