  The module-level logger declaration at line 665 in agent.py is placed after all class definitions,
  near the end of the file. Module-level loggers should be declared at the top of the file, after
  imports and before class/function definitions, to make them easily discoverable and to follow
  standard Python conventions for module-level constants.
