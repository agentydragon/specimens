rationale: |
  Lines 293-301 type the snapshot parameter as nullable (`specimen_str: str | None`)
  but immediately check for None and exit with an error. This is a misleading type
  signature that should be replaced with a required parameter, and checking for presence
  should be left up to Typer.
