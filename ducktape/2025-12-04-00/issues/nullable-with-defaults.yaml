  The apply_gitignore_patterns function accepts include and exclude as list[str] | None,
  then checks "if include:" and "if exclude:" at lines 37-42. These parameters should
  instead be Sequence[str] with default=() in the function signature, eliminating the
  need for None checks. This makes the contract clearer and reduces defensive code.
