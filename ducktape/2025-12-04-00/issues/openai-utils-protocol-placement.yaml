rationale: |
  The `OpenAIModelProto` protocol (line 401) is defined AFTER its implementations (`OpenAIModel` at line 345 and
  `BoundOpenAIModel` at line 376). This makes the code harder to understand - readers see implementations before
  understanding the interface contract.

  Additionally, the implementations don't explicitly inherit from the protocol. While structural typing means
  they
  satisfy
  the protocol, explicit inheritance would:
  1. Make the implementation relationship clear and intentional
  2. Catch errors at definition time if the implementation is incomplete
  3. Make it harder to accidentally create unintended implementations

  Better approach: Convert the protocol to an ABC (Abstract Base Class) and define it ABOVE its implementations.
  Have
  implementations explicitly inherit from it:

  ```python
  from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

  class OpenAIModelProto(ABC):
      @property
      @abstractmethod
      def model(self) -> str: ...

      @abstractmethod
      async def responses_create(self, req: ResponsesRequest) -> ResponsesResult: ...

  class OpenAIModel(OpenAIModelProto):
      # ... implementation

  class BoundOpenAIModel(OpenAIModelProto):
      # ... implementation
  ```

  This makes the contract explicit, prevents accidental implementations, and improves code organization.
