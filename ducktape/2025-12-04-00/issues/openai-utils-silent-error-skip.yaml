rationale: |
  The `_message_output_to_assistant` function (lines 281-294) returns `AssistantMessageOut | None`, and when it
  returns
  None (lines 292-293), the caller (lines 330-332) silently skips adding the item to `out_items`.

  This is dangerous for two reasons:

  1. **OpenAI reasoning sensitivity**: OpenAI's reasoning feature is sensitive to being placed in exactly the
  same
  prefix it was sampled from. Silently dropping messages breaks this invariant and can cause subtle bugs.

  2. **Silent error hiding**: If `_message_output_to_assistant` returns None because something went wrong (no
  parts
  found), this should be treated as an error that surfaces immediately, not silently ignored.

  The function should be changed to either:
  - Return a non-nullable `AssistantMessageOut` and raise an exception when parts is empty, OR
  - Have the caller raise an exception when None is returned instead of silently skipping

  Errors must cause breakage/raise, not be silently skipped.
