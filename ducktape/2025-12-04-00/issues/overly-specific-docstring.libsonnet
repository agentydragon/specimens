    Docstring mentions specific use cases (critic/grader) when the functionality is generic and works for any transcript-based agent run. This misleads readers into thinking the handler is specialized when it's actually general-purpose.

    The transcript_id parameter links events to any agent run, not just critic/grader runs. The documentation should reflect this generality.
