  Docstring mentions specific use cases (critic/grader) when the functionality is generic and works for any
  transcript-based agent run. This misleads readers into thinking the handler is specialized when it's actually
  general-purpose.

  The transcript_id parameter links events to any agent run, not just critic/grader runs. The documentation
  should
  reflect
  this generality.
