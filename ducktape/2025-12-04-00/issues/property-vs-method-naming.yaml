  The `.messages` property (lines 626-656) is a thin wrapper around `_to_openai_input_items()` (lines 431-448).
  These should be merged into a single public method named `.to_openai_messages()` for clarity. Using a
  method name instead of a property better signals that this performs a non-trivial conversion (creating
  a new list with transformed items) rather than just accessing state. The "to_" prefix explicitly indicates
  this converts to an external format (OpenAI's), not our internal format.
