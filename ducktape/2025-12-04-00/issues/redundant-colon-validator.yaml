  Lines 31-36 define `_reject_colon` validator that rejects colons in BaseIssueID values. However, this
  validator is
  redundant because the pattern constraint on line 44 already excludes colons.

  The pattern `r"^[a-z0-9_-]+$"` only allows lowercase letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens. Colons are not
  in this
  character class, so any string containing a colon will fail pattern validation before reaching the
  `BeforeValidator(_reject_colon)` on line 45.

  The validator function and its usage should be deleted as they add no value beyond what the pattern already
  enforces.
