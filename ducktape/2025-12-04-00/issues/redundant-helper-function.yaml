rationale: |
  Function read_text_json is a special case of read_text_json_typed with output_type=dict[str, Any].
  Having both functions creates maintenance burden and API surface bloat.
  Either replace callers to use read_text_json_typed(session, uri, dict[str, Any]) directly, or delegate
  read_text_json
  to
  call read_text_json_typed internally.
  The preferred approach is to replace callers, as it makes the type contract explicit at each call site.
