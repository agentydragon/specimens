rationale: |
  Pinned server tracking uses a separate set _pinned_servers instead of storing the flag in _MountState.
  This splits mount state across two data structures, making it harder to reason about mount lifecycle.
  The pinned flag should be a boolean field in _MountState (e.g., pinned: bool = False).
  This centralizes all mount state in one place and eliminates the need to keep _pinned_servers synchronized.
