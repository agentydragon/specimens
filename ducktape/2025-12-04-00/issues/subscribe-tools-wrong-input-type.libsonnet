    Lines 386 and 413 define subscribe/unsubscribe tools that use ResourcesReadArgs as their input type. However, ResourcesReadArgs includes windowing parameters (start_offset and max_bytes on lines 51-52) that are only relevant for reading resources, not for subscribing/unsubscribing.

    The subscribe and unsubscribe tools only use input.server and input.uri - they never access the windowing parameters. These tools should use a separate, simpler input type (e.g., ResourceSubscriptionArgs) with just server and uri fields, making the tool interface clearer and avoiding unnecessary parameters.
