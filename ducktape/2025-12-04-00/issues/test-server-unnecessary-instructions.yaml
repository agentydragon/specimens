  Lines 42 and 159 set instructions parameters when creating test MCP servers (NotifyingFastMCP), but these
  instructions
  values are never referenced, asserted on, or otherwise used in the test logic. They're immaterial fluff that
  should be
  removed.

  Test servers should only set parameters that are relevant to what's being tested. Since these tests are about
  notification flow (ResourceUpdated broadcasts, buffering, etc.), the instructions content is irrelevant.
