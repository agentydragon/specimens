rationale: |
  The entire `ChecklistItem` Pydantic model class (lines 118-132) and its associated field definition (lines
  133-136)
  are
  commented out with the rationale "checklist handling is currently disabled" (line 117).

  A ripgrep search across the entire codebase confirms no active usage of `ChecklistItem` - only the
  commented-out
  definition itself and its internal self-references appear.

  This represents ~20 lines of dead code. When a feature is disabled and its models are unused, the commented
  code
  should
  be removed rather than left in place. Commented-out code creates maintenance burden:
  - Readers must mentally parse whether it's relevant
  - It doesn't get updated when related code changes
  - It's unclear whether it's meant to be re-enabled or is permanently obsolete

  If the checklist feature might be re-enabled, the proper approach is to preserve it in git history (where it
  can be
  recovered via `git log -S "ChecklistItem"`) rather than cluttering the active codebase.
