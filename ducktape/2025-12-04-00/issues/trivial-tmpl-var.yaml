  In _load_instructions(), the `tmpl` variable is assigned on one line and used
  immediately on the next line. This trivial variable adds no clarity and should
  be inlined:

  Current code (lines 384-385):
    tmpl = Template(raw)
    rendered = tmpl.render(...)

  Should be:
    rendered = Template(raw).render(...)

  The inline form fits easily on one line and eliminates an unnecessary variable.
