rationale: |
  The _raise_if_reserved_code() function defensively guards access to error.code
  and error.message with try/except Exception blocks, but this is unnecessary:

  - error.code is typed as int (not Optional[int]) in ErrorData
  - error.message is typed as str (not Optional[str]) in ErrorData

  Current code (lines 168-179):
    code: int | None = None
    msg: str | None = None
    error = e.error
    try:
        code = int(error.code)
    except Exception:
        code = None
    try:
        msg = str(error.message)
    except Exception:
        msg = None

  The int() and str() conversions are also redundant - the fields are already
  the correct types. The function should directly use error.code and error.message:

    code = error.code  # already int
    msg = error.message  # already str

  This simplifies the code and removes unnecessary exception handling that can
  never trigger (unless there's a fundamental type system violation).
