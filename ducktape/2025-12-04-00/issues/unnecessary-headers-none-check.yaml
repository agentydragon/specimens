  Lines 346-348 construct headers dict, then pass headers=headers or None to StreamableHttpTransport.
  The code should verify whether StreamableHttpTransport treats headers=None differently from headers={}.
  If they are equivalent, simplify to headers=headers (remove the "or None" check).
  This eliminates unnecessary complexity unless there's a semantic difference.
