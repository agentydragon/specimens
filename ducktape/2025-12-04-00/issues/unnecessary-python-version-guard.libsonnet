    Lines 25-31 in arg0_runner.py include a try/except AttributeError guard for
    Python versions older than 3.11:

    try:
        # Python 3.11+: use is_relative_to for robust ancestor check
        if not p.is_relative_to(root):
            raise ValueError
    except AttributeError:  # pragma: no cover - fallback for older Pythons
        if str(p).startswith(str(root)) is False:
            raise ValueError

    However, the project's pyproject.toml requires Python >=3.12:

    requires-python = ">=3.12,<3.14"

    The `is_relative_to()` method was added in Python 3.9, so this compatibility
    guard is completely unnecessary. The code can never run on a Python version
    that lacks this method.

    The guard should be removed, leaving only:

    if not p.is_relative_to(root):
        raise ValueError

    Unnecessary compatibility guards add complexity and mislead readers about
    the supported Python versions. When the minimum Python version is clearly
    specified in pyproject.toml, the code should assume that version's features
    are available.
