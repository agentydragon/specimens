rationale: |
  The `_run_impl` method has a return type of `-> None` and contains two explicit `return` statements that
  should be
  removed:

  **Line 215**: Plain `return` after the try/except/finally block. Since the function returns `None`,
  this explicit return is unnecessary - the function will implicitly return None when it reaches the end.

  **Line 218**: Plain `return` at the very end of the method after the error logging. This is redundant since
  Python
  functions implicitly return None at the end.

  Unnecessary return statements add visual noise without providing value. In functions that return `None`, only
  early
  returns (to exit the function before reaching the end) are meaningful.
