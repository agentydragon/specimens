  The active_policy() resource handler unnecessarily calls get_policy() which
  returns a tuple (source, version), then unpacks and discards the version:

  Current code (lines 566-568):
    def active_policy() -> str:
        content, _version = self.get_policy()
        return content

  This is awkward and requires unpacking a tuple just to discard half of it.
  Since the function only needs the policy source, it should directly access
  the private field:

    def active_policy() -> str:
        return self._policy_source

  Note: get_policy() has legitimate users that need both source and version
  (tests in test_preset_policy_loading.py verify version increments). But this
  resource handler only needs the source.

  Similar pattern exists in agent/policy_eval/container.py:38, but that's in
  a different context (agent layer calling into MCP layer).
