rationale: |
  The `calculate_cost()` function in `cost.py` duplicates logic that already exists in the database `run_costs`
  view and
  is never called.

  All cost calculations in the codebase are performed by the database view (defined in
  `src/adgn/props/db/models.py:588-636`), which:
  - Aggregates token usage from the `events` table
  - Joins with `model_pricing` table for current rates
  - Computes costs using the same formula as this function
  - Is queried by `BudgetEnforcementHandler` via `po_run_costs()` query builder

  The Python function has no callers anywhere in the codebase. It appears to be either early prototype code that
  was
  superseded by the database approach, or documentation/reference code that was never meant to be called.

  Keeping both implementations creates:
  - Duplication risk: changes to pricing logic must be made in two places
  - Inconsistency risk: implementations could drift apart
  - Maintenance burden: extra file to maintain and understand

  The database view is the single source of truth and should remain so.
