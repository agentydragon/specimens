  The shared test helper `make_typed_mcp` takes an unused `name` argument. The value is ignored inside the
  contextmanager and every call site simply forwards a constant string. This adds noise to every invocation and
  suggests a feature that does not exist. Drop the unused parameter so call sites become `make_typed_mcp(server)`
  and the helper signature reflects its actual behavior.
