  Line 177 in server/app.py contains a useless comment:
  "# Create middleware instance"

  This comment should be deleted because:

  1. The code immediately following is self-documenting:
     middleware = MCPRoutingMiddleware(...)

  2. The comment merely restates what the code obviously does (assigns to a
     variable named "middleware" by calling a constructor named
     "MCPRoutingMiddleware")

  3. It provides no additional context, reasoning, or non-obvious information

  Comments that simply restate what the code does add noise without value.
  Only keep comments that explain WHY (intent/reasoning) or document
  non-obvious aspects, not WHAT (which should be clear from the code itself).
