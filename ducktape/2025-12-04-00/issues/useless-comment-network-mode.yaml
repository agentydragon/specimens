rationale: |
  Line 132 has a useless comment "# Apply network mode if not 'none'" that merely restates what the immediately
  following
  code does, without adding any useful context or explanation.

  **Current code:**
  ```python
  # Apply network mode if not 'none'
  if opts.network_mode != "none":
      host_config["NetworkMode"] = opts.network_mode
  ```

  **Why this comment is useless:**
  - The comment literally restates the condition ("if not 'none'") visible in the code
  - It doesn't explain WHY we guard against "none" (which is actually questionable - see related issue about
  unnecessary guards)
  - It doesn't provide context that isn't immediately obvious from reading the code
  - "Apply network mode" is self-evident from the assignment statement

  **Good comments explain WHY, not WHAT:**
  - A useful comment would explain the reasoning: "Docker requires explicit NetworkMode setting even for 'none'"
  - Or document a gotcha: "Setting NetworkMode='none' causes issue X, so we omit it"
  - But this comment just narrates the code

  **Fix:**
  Remove the comment entirely. If the guard is kept (though it shouldn't be - see related issue), the code is
  self-documenting. If there IS a reason for the guard, document that reason instead.

  **Related issues:**
  - The guard `if opts.network_mode != "none"` is itself unnecessary (see separate issue about unnecessary
  guards in
  _build_host_config)
