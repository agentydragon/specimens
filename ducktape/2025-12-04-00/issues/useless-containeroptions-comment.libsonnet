    The docstring comment "Callers must pass a fully constructed ContainerOptions (no kwargs)" in `make_container_exec_server` is obvious and useless. The function signature already shows `opts: ContainerOptions` as a required parameter with no kwargs accepted for the opts itself.

    This comment adds no information beyond what the type annotation already communicates. Delete it.
