rationale: |
  The docstring comment "Callers must pass a fully constructed ContainerOptions (no kwargs)" in
  `make_container_exec_server` is obvious and useless. The function signature already shows `opts:
  ContainerOptions` as
  a
  required parameter with no kwargs accepted for the opts itself.

  This comment adds no information beyond what the type annotation already communicates. Delete it.
