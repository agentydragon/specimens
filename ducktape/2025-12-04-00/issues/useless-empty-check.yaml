rationale: |
  Lines 311-312 silently succeed when given an empty server name: "if name in ('',): return". This is wrong
  because if
  validation fails and an empty string reaches this point, the caller receives None (appearing like success)
  instead of
  a
  clear error.

  If the upstream validation at line 253 is reliable, this check is redundant and should be removed. If this is
  meant as
  a
  defensive check against validation failures, it should raise ValueError("server name cannot be empty") rather
  than
  silently returning. Silent success on invalid input masks bugs and makes debugging harder.
