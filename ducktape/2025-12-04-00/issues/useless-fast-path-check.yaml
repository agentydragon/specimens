  Lines 620-621 in agent.py contain a useless fast-path return that checks if there are pending
  function calls before iterating and emitting results. This check doesn't provide any performance
  benefit since the following loop (lines 622-624) would naturally be a no-op if the list is empty.
  The early return adds unnecessary code without improving performance or clarity.
