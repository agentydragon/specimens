  Line 232 uses uuid4() for test database names. The issue suggests using actual test IDs if available
  from pytest (e.g., request.node.nodeid) and applying a whitelist-based sanitizer (keep
  alphanumeric/underscore,
  reject special chars) instead of just replacing hyphens. The length limit could also be increased to something
  more reasonable like 128 characters if PostgreSQL allows it.
