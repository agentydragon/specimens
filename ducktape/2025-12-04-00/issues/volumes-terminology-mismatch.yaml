  Field is named `volumes` but we're just passing data straight to Docker's `HostConfig.Binds`.
  We're not adding any abstraction or doing anything different—just using a different name for
  the same concept. Comments even say "Convert volumes to binds format" (line 111), but there's
  no actual conversion, just a rename.

  "Volumes" is kinda-correct (colloquially people say "mount a volume") but actually wrong in
  Docker terminology: "volumes" are managed storage in /var/lib/docker/volumes/, while "bind
  mounts" are host paths. Our code only handles bind mounts.

  No benefit to our own terminology. Rename to `binds` to align with Docker: ContainerOptions
  (line 48), ContainerSessionState (line 34), _build_host_config (lines 96-129).
