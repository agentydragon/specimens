This conversation will be summarized and handed off to a successor agent to complete.
The agent will start with the same state of tools as the conversation ended in, but will not be able to read the conversation - only the summary.
Produce the conversation summary, aiming to give the successor information needed to complete the task successfully.

Guidelines:

- Extract important facts, decisions made, and goals established
- Preserve specific details (file paths, issue IDs, tool outputs that informed decisions)
- Omit redundant exchanges and verbose explanations
- Format as a concise narrative in past tense
- Keep it under 2000 words
