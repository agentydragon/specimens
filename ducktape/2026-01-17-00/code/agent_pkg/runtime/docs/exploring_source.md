## Beyond This Bootstrap

This bootstrap provides essential context, but you have full access to source code:

- **Installed packages**: `/packages/` — Python packages available in your environment
- **CLI implementations**: Look for `cli.py` modules in relevant packages
- **Examples**: Some packages include `examples/` with runnable Python

When the CLI help or docs don't answer your question, read the implementation.
