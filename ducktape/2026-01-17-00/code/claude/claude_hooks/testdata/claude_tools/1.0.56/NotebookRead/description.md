# NotebookRead Tool

Reads a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) and returns all of the cells with their outputs. Jupyter notebooks are interactive documents that combine code, text, and visualizations, commonly used for data analysis and scientific computing. The notebook_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path.
