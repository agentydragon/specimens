rationale: |
  `PRState` (github_models.py:49-52) and `PRStatus` (github_models.py:15-46)
  are near-synonym names for distinct concepts: `PRState` is the raw GitHub
  API state (open/closed/merged), while `PRStatus` is a derived rich status
  combining state + mergeability (open_mergeable, open_conflicting, etc.).
  Both are StrEnums defined adjacently. The naming makes it easy to confuse
  them — "state" and "status" are synonyms in everyday use.

  Rename one to clarify the distinction, e.g. `PRStatus` →
  `PRDetailedStatus` or `PRMergeStatus`, or `PRState` → `PRGitHubState` /
  `PRRawState`.
