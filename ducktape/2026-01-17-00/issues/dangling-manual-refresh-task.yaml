rationale: |
  GitHubWatcher.trigger_refresh() creates a task and stores it in
  _manual_refresh_task, but this task is never cleaned up in stop().
  The stop() method only cancels _periodic_task, leaving _manual_refresh_task
  to run unsupervised. If the task raises an exception, it will be silently
  lost. Should either add done callback for error logging, or cancel/await
  in stop() alongside the periodic task.

    _manual_refresh_task is created but not cancelled in stop() (lines 71-80
    only handle _periodic_task). Task errors are silently lost.
