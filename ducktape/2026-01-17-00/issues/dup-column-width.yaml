rationale: |
  Lines 40-41 duplicate the column width (4) and blank-padding width (5)
  across the two branches of each ternary. The width constant appears in
  both the format spec and the else-branch space literal. Factor out: e.g.
  build the numeric string independently (`str(behind)` or `""`), then
  rjust/ljust by the width and append the arrow or space. This deduplicates
  the width and makes the two halves structurally parallel.

  The `ahead == 0 and behind == 0` special case (lines 37-38) should also be
  removed — it's subsumed by the general path once refactored, and is
  currently subtly inconsistent (returns 10 spaces vs the 11 the general
  path would produce).
