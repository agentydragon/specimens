  `worktree_identify` raises the same `RpcError(code=ErrorCodes.WORKTREE_NOT_FOUND,
  message=f"{absolute_path} is not a managed worktree")` on four separate guard
  clauses (lines 159, 170, 173, 177). The error code alone carries the semantic
  meaning for the protocol; the f-string message is redundant noise repeated
  identically. Dropping the message (making it optional or defaulting it from
  the code) would make the four raises trivially short and the duplication
  acceptable.
