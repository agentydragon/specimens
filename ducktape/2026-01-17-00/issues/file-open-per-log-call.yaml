rationale: |
  JSONLLogger.log() opens and closes the file on every single log call. This is
  inefficient I/O - file open/close has OS overhead, provides no buffering benefit,
  and creates contention under frequent logging. Should keep the file handle open
  as instance state (opened in __init__, closed in __del__ or via context manager),
  or use the standard logging.FileHandler pattern which handles this properly.
