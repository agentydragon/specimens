rationale: |
  `pr_info` is initialized as `""` (line 195), conditionally reassigned inside
  an `if pr_link:` block (lines 207-213), then used once (line 221). This
  widens the scope of mutable state. Instead, build `pr_parts` unconditionally
  as `[pr_link]` if truthy (else `[]`), append status/changes, and inline
  `" ".join(pr_parts)` at the use site. Eliminates the `pr_info` variable and
  the `if` block.
