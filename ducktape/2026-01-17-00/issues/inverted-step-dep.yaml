rationale: |
  `responses.py` is the low-level response-building layer. `steps.py` defines
  the `Step` Protocol and concrete step implementations that consume
  `ResponsesFactory` from `responses.py`. The dependency should be
  steps → responses (higher layer depends on lower layer).

  Instead, `responses.py` imports `Step` from `steps.py` (line 46) because
  `StepRunner` (line 134) and the `make_step_runner` fixture (line 493) live
  in `responses.py`. This inverts the layering: the lower-level module depends
  on the higher-level one.

  Fix: move `StepRunner` and `make_step_runner` into `steps.py`. The dependency
  becomes one-directional: steps → responses.
