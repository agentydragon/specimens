rationale: |
  _initial_status_task is assigned a new asyncio.Task each time a worktree's
  gitstatusd starts, overwriting any previous task reference. If multiple
  worktrees start in quick succession, earlier tasks become orphaned - they
  continue running but if they raise exceptions, the errors are silently lost.
  Should track background tasks in a set with done-callback cleanup, and
  cancel/await them at shutdown. Note: _startup_tasks list exists at line 189
  but is never used - could be repurposed for this.

    Earlier tasks become orphaned with no error handling. Should use a set
    with done-callback cleanup pattern.
