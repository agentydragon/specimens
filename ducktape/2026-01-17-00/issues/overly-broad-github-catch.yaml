  Catches bare Exception when accessing GitHub repo, which includes programming
  errors like TypeError and AttributeError that should propagate. PyGithub has
  a well-defined exception hierarchy: GithubException (base for API errors with
  subclasses for 401/403/404/rate-limit), BadAttributeException (type errors),
  and network errors via requests.RequestException. At most, should catch
  (github.GithubException, github.BadAttributeException, requests.RequestException).
  Whether to catch all three or a subset is a judgment call, but catching bare
  Exception is too broad and will swallow programming errors.

    except Exception catches all errors including programming bugs. At most,
    should catch (github.GithubException, github.BadAttributeException,
    requests.RequestException) - not bare Exception.
