rationale: |
  ClaudeRunner.cleanup() uses print() for error output instead of the
  self.logger that is available from the base class AgentRunner. This is
  inconsistent with the rest of the codebase which uses structured logging.
  The message will not appear in structured logs and lacks the context
  (runner_id, task info) that the logger would provide.

    print(f"Error cleaning up workspace: {e}") should use self.logger.error()
