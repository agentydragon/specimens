rationale: |
  GitstatusdService stores the same callable twice: as self._get_client (line 75)
  and self.get_client (line 81). Both point to the identical lambda. Internal
  methods use _get_client while external callers use get_client. Should pick one:
  either keep only _get_client and add a trivial wrapper method for the public API,
  or keep only get_client and use it everywhere. The duplication adds confusion
  without benefit. Same pattern appears with DiscoveryService.is_scanning at
  lines 118 and 122.

    Pick one - either private with wrapper method, or public used everywhere.

    Same redundant pattern as GitstatusdService.
