  `test_app_level_error_payload_surfaced_in_structured_content` (line 95)
  tests that a successful MCP result with `{"ok": False, "error": "boom"}`
  in structuredContent passes through to the agent. MCP does not distinguish
  this from any other successful structured content — the `{"ok": False}`
  convention is meaningless at the MCP layer. This is already covered by
  `test_mcp_integration.py` which asserts structured content passthrough
  (line 37: `has_entries(echo="hello")`, line 56: direct equality check).
  Delete the redundant test and its `error_payload_server` fixture.
