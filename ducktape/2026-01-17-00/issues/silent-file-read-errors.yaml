  FileCollector.collect_files() catches ValueError and OSError when reading
  files but silently continues without any logging or warning. If a file
  exists but cannot be read due to permissions, corruption, or transient
  errors, the user has no indication anything went wrong. Per STYLE.md:
  "Real errors must surface." At minimum, these errors should be logged
  so users can diagnose issues with their file collection.
