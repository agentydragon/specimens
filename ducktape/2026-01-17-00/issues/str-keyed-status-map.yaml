rationale: |
  `PR_STATUS_DISPLAY_MAP` (view_formatter.py:14-20) is keyed by
  `PRStatus.*.display_text` strings rather than `PRStatus` enum values.
  `get_pr_status_text` (lines 61-80) manually resolves `PRState` + mergeability
  + merged_at into a display string, duplicating the `PRState → PRStatus`
  resolution that should produce a `PRStatus` enum value. The lookup site
  (line 287) then compares this string output against display-text keys.

  The entire chain is string-based when it should be enum-based:
  `get_pr_status_text` should return `PRStatus` (not `str`), the map should
  be keyed by `PRStatus`, and display formatting should happen at the end.
  As-is, any change to `display_text` silently breaks the map lookup.
