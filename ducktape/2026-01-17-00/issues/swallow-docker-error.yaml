rationale: |
  Broad exception catching around docker image inspection silently swallows all errors.

  The current code catches bare `Exception` when checking if an image exists locally:
  ```python
  try:
      image = await docker.images.inspect(full_ref)
      ...
  except Exception:
      pass  # Image not found locally, need to pull
  ```

  This swallows network errors, Docker daemon issues, permission problems, and other
  real failures that should surface.

  When an image doesn't exist, aiodocker raises `aiodocker.DockerError` with `status == 404`.
  The codebase already uses the correct pattern in `agent_pkg/host/builder.py:86`:
  ```python
  except aiodocker.DockerError as e:
      if e.status != 404:
          raise
  ```

  Should catch `aiodocker.DockerError` specifically and only suppress 404 (not found),
  re-raising other errors.
