rationale: |
  Broad exception catching around YAML parsing silently swallows errors that should be visible.

  Problems with current code:
  1. Catches Exception instead of specific yaml parsing errors
  2. try/except wraps both yaml.safe_load_all AND the processing loop - bugs in loop logic would be silently ignored
  3. No logging of the error - failures are completely invisible

  Should at minimum:
  - Narrow the try/except to only wrap yaml.safe_load_all
  - Catch only yaml.YAMLError, not Exception
  - Log the error visibly (warning or error level)

  Arguably should also fail on malformed YAML, though there's a separate YAML validator that runs before this.
