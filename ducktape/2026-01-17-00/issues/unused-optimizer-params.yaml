rationale: |
  OptimizeArgs dataclass defines three parameters that are never used:
  rollouts_per_task, max_parallel_rollouts, and tasks_per_iteration.
  The optimize_prompts() function delegates to optimize_prompts_mcp() without
  passing these values. The main() function sets them but they have no effect.
  Either these should be wired through to the downstream implementation, or
  deleted to avoid misleading callers into thinking they control behavior.
