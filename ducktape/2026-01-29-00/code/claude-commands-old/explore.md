Explore possibilities for any challenge using multiple creative heuristics and brainstorming techniques.

When given ANY problem, question, or area to explore (design, strategy, philosophy, art, science, life decisions, etc.), follow this systematic exploration process:

**IMPORTANT**: Where possible, spawn multiple parallel sub-agents to explore different angles simultaneously. For example:

- One agent exploring prior art while another generates wild ideas
- Separate agents for different domains (nature-inspired, tech-based, historical)
- Parallel exploration of opposite extremes (tiny vs huge, fast vs slow)
  This maximizes idea generation and cross-pollination.

## Phase 1: Divergent Exploration (NO EVALUATION)

### 0. **Understand the Exploration Space** (from Polya)

- What exactly are we exploring? State it in different ways
- What would a successful outcome look like?
- Have we explored something similar before?
- Can we break this into smaller parts to explore?

### Parallel Exploration Threads (spawn sub-agents for each)

#### Thread A: **Prior Art & Analogies**

- How have others approached this or similar challenges?
- What can we learn from completely different domains?
- What patterns exist in nature, history, or other fields?

#### Thread B: **Scale & Magnitude Play**

- Make it tiny: What's the absolute simplest version?
- Make it huge: What if resources were infinite?
- Change the timeline: What if you had 1 hour vs 10 years?
- Change the scope: Personal vs global, individual vs collective?

#### Thread C: **Constraint Manipulation**

- Remove all constraints: What's the dream scenario?
- Add extreme constraints: What if you had almost nothing?
- Flip constraints: What if limitations became features?
- Wrong answers only: What definitely WOULDN'T work? (then examine why)

#### Thread D: **Cross-Domain Inspiration**

- How would different professions approach this? (artist, engineer, child, philosopher)
- What would this look like in different cultures or time periods?
- How does nature handle similar challenges?
- What would fictional characters or historical figures do?

#### Thread E: **Wild & Absurd Ideas**

- Generate deliberately silly approaches
- Combine completely unrelated concepts
- Reverse or invert the entire premise
- What would break all conventions or social norms?
- What would make people laugh, then think?

#### Thread F: **Method & Medium Variations**

- High-tech vs no-tech approaches
- Digital vs physical vs hybrid
- Solo vs collaborative vs crowdsourced
- Active vs passive approaches
- Traditional vs cutting-edge methods

## Phase 2: Pattern Recognition & Synthesis

### Apply Polya's Heuristics

- **Look for patterns**: What themes keep appearing?
- **Work backwards**: If we had the perfect solution, what would it look like?
- **Auxiliary problems**: What easier version could we solve first?
- **Generalize/Specialize**: Make it more abstract or more concrete
- **Use symmetry**: What's the opposite? What's the complement?

### Capture Everything

- List ALL ideas, no matter how impractical
- Group by underlying principles, not surface features
- Note surprising connections between distant ideas
- Identify which "silly" ideas have kernels of brilliance

## Phase 3: Develop Evaluation Criteria

Before presenting options, invent creative and unexpected criteria for evaluation:

### Think beyond standard metrics

- What would success look like in this specific context?
- What dimensions of quality matter that we haven't named yet?
- What would different stakeholders care about?
- What are the non-obvious factors that could make or break this?

### Examples of unconventional criteria to inspire you

- **Elegance**: Does it feel intellectually satisfying?
- **Memetic potential**: Will people naturally want to share/adopt it?
- **Reversibility**: How easy to undo if we're wrong?
- **Compositional power**: Does it unlock other possibilities?
- **Emotional resonance**: How does it make people feel?
- **Systemic effects**: What ripples might it create?
- **Narrative coherence**: Does it tell a compelling story?
- **Antifragility**: Does it get stronger under stress?

### Invent criteria specific to this challenge

- What unique aspects of this problem suggest new evaluation lenses?
- What would a philosopher/artist/scientist uniquely value here?
- What criteria would reveal hidden gems among "silly" ideas?
- What measures would capture long-term or indirect value?
- What would matter in 10 years that doesn't seem important today?

## Phase 4: Present Options

Present findings as:

1. **Conventional approaches** (3-5 options)
2. **Innovative approaches** (3-5 options)
3. **Wild cards** (2-3 surprising options)
4. **Hybrid solutions** (combinations of above)

For each option, briefly note:

- Core concept
- Key advantages
- Major challenges
- Unique insights
- Quick scoring on top 3-4 criteria (without eliminating options)

**Remember**:

- Quantity over quality in exploration phase
- No criticism during brainstorming
- Look for gems in "silly" ideas
- Cross-pollinate concepts
- Challenge every assumption
