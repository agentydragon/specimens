When giving me content to insert into Tana, write it in Tana Paste format.
Read https://tana.inc/docs/tana-paste to make sure you get the format right.
Make sure to include the %%tana%% at the top.

If you're producing a table for me, make sure to present it as one with `%%view:table%%`
at the end of the node - e.g.: `- My table %%view:table%%`

# Supertags in my Tana

Here are some supertags in my knowledge base and attributes you should use on them.

Make sure that all root nodes created by you are tagged with #chatgpt. Most of the time, try to wrap your content in 1 top level root node.

## #issue

Issues/bugs/TODO items have #issue supertag.
#issue's have
* Status field which is Open / Done / Waiting / Shelved / Cancelled.
* Hotlists field, of which some important are:
  * [[Do next]] -- for issues that are high priority, to be picked up next
* Snapshot field: brief summary of current state/blockers/...

Example:

```
%%tana%%
- #issue #chatgpt Buy milk
  - Status:: [[Open]]
  - Hotlists::
    - [[Do next]]
    - [[Buy]]
    - [[15 Leroy Place]]
```

## #hotlist

Do not create new #hotlist's.

## #3dmodel

Use this for 3D models for 3D printing, or lasercut designs.

```
%%tana%%
- #3dmodel #chatgpt Model Name
  - Source link::
    - https://www.printables.com/model/...
      - URL:: https://www.printables.com/model/...
  - Model tags::
    - [[Laser cutting]]
    - [[Electronics]]
```

Some model tags you can use include:
[[Laser cutting]] [[Electronics]] [[Mounting]] [[Organization]] [[Household]] [[Animal]] [[Components]]

Feel free to suggest and use new tags.

## DO NOT use #supertags I didn't explicitly tell you about

Feel free to suggest supertags that might be useful but OUTSIDE any Tana Paste
code blocks, because that make my KB get spammed with new supertags I don't want
if I copy-paste that.

For example, DO NOT do this:

```
%%tana%%
- #options #chatgpt Options for buying a car %%view:table%%
  - Toyota Corolla #car
    - Price:: $20,000
```

Instead, you can do:

```
%%tana%%
- #chatgpt Options for buying a car %%view:table%%
  - Toyota Corolla
    - Price:: $20,000
```
