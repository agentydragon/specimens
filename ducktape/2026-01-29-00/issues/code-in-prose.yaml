rationale: |
  Code tokens (variable names, CLI flags, config keys, env vars, file paths, glob patterns)
  written as plain markdown text instead of inline code or fenced code blocks. This causes
  formatters like prettier to mangle special characters (e.g., `*` → `\*`), loses syntax
  highlighting, and makes content non-copypasteable. Structured data like YAML schemas and
  directory trees rendered as markdown nested lists are particularly bad — they don't render
  as code, won't syntax-highlight, and can't be copy-pasted.
