rationale: |
  `decide_call` resolves DENY_CONTINUE with `ContinueDecision()` (line 532),
  identical to APPROVE (line 526). The gateway's `on_call_tool` treats
  `ContinueDecision` as permission to execute: it calls `call_next(context)`
  (line 362), which runs the tool. So a human operator who denies a tool call
  with "deny but continue the turn" sees the tool execute anyway. The
  gateway's own policy-evaluation path handles DENY_CONTINUE correctly by
  raising `_policy_denied_error` (lines 345-348), but the admin decision
  path does not — the hub's binary type system (`ContinueDecision |
  AbortTurnDecision`) cannot represent "skip execution, continue turn."
