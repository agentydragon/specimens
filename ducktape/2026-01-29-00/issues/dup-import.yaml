  `gmail_client.py` imports `format_truncation_suffix` twice from different
  module paths (line 17 from `fmt_util`, line 18 from `fmt_util.fmt_util`).
  The second import shadows the first. If the two module paths ever diverge
  (e.g., the package `__init__` re-export is removed), the shadowed import
  silently changes behavior. One of the two imports should be removed.
