rationale: |
  `GmailInbox.fetch_messages_metadata` silently drops messages that are in
  `_full_cache` but not `_metadata_cache`. Line 77 skips re-fetching IDs
  already in `_full_cache` (correct, since full data is a superset of
  metadata). But lines 94-97 then fail to include those IDs in the result:
  the `elif mid in self._full_cache` branch executes `pass` instead of
  appending to `result`. Any message previously fetched via `fetch_messages`
  (which populates `_full_cache`) will be silently omitted from subsequent
  `fetch_messages_metadata` calls.
