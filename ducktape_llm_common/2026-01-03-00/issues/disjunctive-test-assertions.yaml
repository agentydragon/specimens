  Test assertions use disjunctions (OR conditions) to accept multiple different
  outputs as passing. This is a code smell - tests should have a single clear
  expected outcome. Disjunctive assertions indicate either:
  1. The test doesn't know what behavior to expect (unclear requirements)
  2. The test is covering multiple scenarios that should be separate tests
  3. The production code has inconsistent output that should be normalized
