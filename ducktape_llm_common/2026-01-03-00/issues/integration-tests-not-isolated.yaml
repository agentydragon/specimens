rationale: |
  Integration tests use hardcoded session IDs and write to the real user data
  directory (~/.local/share/claude-linter-v2/sessions/). This causes:
  1. Tests to interfere with each other across runs
  2. Tests to pick up stale state from previous runs
  3. Potential interference with real user session data
  4. Non-deterministic test failures when stale data has incompatible format
