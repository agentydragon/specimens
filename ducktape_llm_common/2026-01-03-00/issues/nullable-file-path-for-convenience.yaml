rationale: |
  `file_path: str | None` parameters in python_formatter.py are only nullable for
  test convenience. Production callers (checker.py:87, handler.py:671) always pass
  a file_path. The None case triggers fallback to "temp.py" for ruff's --stdin-filename.

  The signature should be `file_path: Path` with no default, and tests should pass
  explicit test paths instead of relying on None defaults. This eliminates unnecessary
  nullability guards and makes the production contract explicit.
