  SessionData.id field is typed as str but should be typed as SessionID (UUID).
  Pydantic 2 supports UUID serialization/deserialization natively, so there's
  no need to store it as a string. Using the correct type provides type safety
  and avoids unnecessary str() conversions in tests and application code.
