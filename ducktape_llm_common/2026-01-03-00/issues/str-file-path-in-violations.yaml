rationale: |
  ViolationTracker methods take `file_path: str` instead of `file_path: Path`.
  Even though the paths are stored as strings in dicts, callers already have Path
  objects and must convert to str. The interface should accept Path and convert
  internally if needed for storage.

  Change signatures to `file_path: Path` and convert to str only at storage point.
