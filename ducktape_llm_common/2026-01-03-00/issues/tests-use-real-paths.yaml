rationale: |
  Tests use hardcoded /tmp/ paths instead of pytest's tmp_path fixture, and scan
  the actual working directory instead of a predictable test directory. This causes:
  1. Tests to operate on real filesystem locations that may have stale state
  2. Stop hook tests to find violations in the actual codebase, not test fixtures
  3. Non-deterministic test behavior depending on cwd and /tmp/ contents
  4. Potential interference between parallel test runs
