  autoclean_inbox's execute_action makes individual API calls per message per label:

      for label in action.labels_to_add:
          client.add_label(message_id, label)

  This is slow for bulk operations. The filters CLI (cli/filters.py:368-391) properly
  batches by grouping messages with identical label changes and using batchModify.
  autoclean should use the same batching pattern for efficiency.
