  `_get_retry_after` wraps its timestamp-parsing logic (lines 66-77) in
  `except Exception` (line 78), which stores the error string in debug_info
  and falls through to returning None. This is too broad: the only expected
  failure is `ValueError` from `fromisoformat()` on a malformed timestamp.
  Catching `Exception` silently swallows programming errors — currently it
  masks an `AttributeError` from `datetime.UTC` on line 74 (separate issue),
  making the entire Retry-After timestamp branch dead code without any
  visible error. Narrow to `except ValueError` so real bugs surface.
