  "core.py" is a meaningless name like "util.py" or "misc.py". There's no way to
  know what belongs in "core" vs "not core" - it's just a dumping ground for
  things that didn't fit elsewhere.

  Delete core.py and name modules after what they actually contain:
  - plan.py: Plan, Action, PlannedAction classes
  - plan_display.py: display_plan, summarize_plan, table formatting functions

  If you can't name a module after its contents, that's a sign the contents
  don't belong together.
