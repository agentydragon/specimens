  Line 65 allows `dict[str, Any]` in the union type for `CompoundCondition.not_`:
  `not_: Union[str, "CompoundCondition", dict[str, Any]] | None`

  This bypasses Pydantic validation entirely. If the YAML contains an invalid
  nested structure, Pydantic will accept it as a raw dict rather than validating
  it against the CompoundCondition schema. The model already supports recursive
  CompoundCondition via forward references, so the dict[str, Any] fallback serves
  no purpose except to silently accept malformed input.

  Remove `dict[str, Any]` from the union. The type should be:
  `not_: str | CompoundCondition | None`

  This ensures all nested `not` conditions are validated against the
  CompoundCondition schema.
