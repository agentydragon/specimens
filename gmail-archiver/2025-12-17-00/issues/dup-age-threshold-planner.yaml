rationale: |
  Four planners (AnthemEobPlanner, AnthemReimbursementPlanner, UspsPlanner,
  AnthropicReceiptPlanner) implement identical age-based archival logic:
  fetch messages → compute cutoff date → loop (parse, compare date to cutoff,
  archive if old or keep if recent) → count and report. Each has ~35 lines of
  boilerplate that differ only in the query string, parse function, and day
  threshold. Extract a common base or generic function parameterized by these
  three values.
