rationale: |
  Four planners (AnthemEobPlanner, AnthemReimbursementPlanner, UspsPlanner,
  AnthropicReceiptPlanner) implement identical age-based archival logic:
  fetch messages → compute cutoff date → loop (parse, compare date to cutoff,
  archive if old or keep if recent) → count and report. Each has ~35 lines of
  boilerplate that differ only in the query string, parse function, day
  threshold, and which parsed field provides the date. Extract a shared base
  class (e.g., `AgeThresholdPlanner`) parameterized by these values, with
  concrete planners declaring only their query, threshold, and a
  `get_date(parsed) -> datetime | None` method. The per-planner
  timezone-normalization boilerplate (naive → UTC) and the archive/keep/report
  logic are identical across all four and belong in the base.
