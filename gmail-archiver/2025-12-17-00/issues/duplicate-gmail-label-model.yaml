rationale: |
  There are two GmailLabel model definitions:
  - gmail_archiver/models.py:30 - simple version with just id, name, type
  - gmail_archiver/gmail_api_models.py:30 - full version with all API fields

  This is confusing and error-prone. There should be one canonical GmailLabel
  model that matches the Gmail API shape, living in gmail_api_models.py.
  The simple version in models.py should be removed and usages updated.
