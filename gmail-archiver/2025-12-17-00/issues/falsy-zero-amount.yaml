  `SquarePlanner.plan` uses `if not parsed.amount:` (line 112) to detect
  missing amounts. `parsed.amount` is `Decimal | None`. `Decimal("0.00")` is
  falsy in Python, so a genuine $0.00 receipt is treated as "no amount found"
  and skipped instead of being evaluated against the threshold. The check
  should be `if parsed.amount is None:`.
