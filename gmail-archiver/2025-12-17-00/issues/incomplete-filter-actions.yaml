  `SingleFilterPlanner.plan()` (lines 93-105) only handles a subset of
  FilterRule action fields: `label`, `star`, `important`/`mark_as_important`
  (add), `archive`, `read`/`mark_as_read` (remove). It ignores `trash`/
  `delete` (should add TRASH), `not_important`/`never_mark_as_important`
  (should remove IMPORTANT), and `not_spam` (should remove SPAM). Compare
  with `normalize_yaml_rule()` in filter_sync.py lines 76-95, which handles
  all of them. A filter with e.g. `trash: true` is correctly synced to Gmail
  (via filter_sync) but silently skipped when applying to existing messages
  (via filter_planner). The two code paths interpret the same FilterRule
  actions with different completeness.
