rationale: |
  FilterRule action interpretation is duplicated across two call sites that
  can drift independently. `SingleFilterPlanner.plan()` (lines 93-105)
  handles `label`, `star`, `important`/`mark_as_important`, `archive`,
  `read`/`mark_as_read` — but ignores `trash`/`delete`, `not_important`/
  `never_mark_as_important`, and `not_spam`. `normalize_yaml_rule()` in
  filter_sync.py (lines 76-95) handles all of them. A filter with e.g.
  `trash: true` is correctly synced to Gmail but silently skipped when
  applying to existing messages. The fix isn't to add the missing cases to
  filter_planner — it's to have a single "FilterRule → add/remove label
  sets" function that both call sites use.
