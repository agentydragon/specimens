rationale: |
  Building a set incrementally with .add() then converting to frozenset is
  inconsistent when other code paths already produce frozensets directly.
  normalize_yaml_rule builds add_labels and remove_labels as mutable sets then
  returns them as frozensets. Using set comprehensions or frozenset() directly
  would be more idiomatic.
