rationale: |
  Multiple planners parse timezone-aware dates with `strptime(..., "%z")`,
  then immediately strip the timezone with `.replace(tzinfo=None)`, then later
  re-assign UTC with `.replace(tzinfo=UTC)`. This silently reinterprets the
  original local time as UTC. For example, an email sent at 17:31:44-0800
  becomes 17:31:44+0000 (8 hours off). While the error is immaterial for the
  current day-scale thresholds, the pattern is semantically wrong. The root
  cause is that `GmailMessage.date` is `str` (models.py line 23), forcing
  every planner to independently parse the Date header — and each does it
  with its own format string and its own incorrect timezone handling. The
  model already has `internal_date: int` (epoch millis from the Gmail API),
  which is a proper timestamp. Either `date` should be parsed to `datetime`
  once at construction time (in `gmail_client.py` where the GmailMessage is
  built), or planners should use `internal_date` for age comparisons and
  avoid parsing the header at all.
