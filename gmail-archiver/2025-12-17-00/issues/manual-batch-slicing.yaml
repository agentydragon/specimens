  Manual batch slicing pattern:

      for i in range(0, len(msg_ids), batch_size):
          batch = msg_ids[i : i + batch_size]

  Python 3.12+ has itertools.batched() which handles this cleanly:

      for batch in itertools.batched(msg_ids, batch_size):

should_flag: true

occurrences:
  - occurrence_id: occ-0
    files:
      gmail_archiver/cli/filters.py:
        - [382, 383]
    critic_scopes_expected_to_recall:
      - [gmail_archiver/cli/filters.py]
