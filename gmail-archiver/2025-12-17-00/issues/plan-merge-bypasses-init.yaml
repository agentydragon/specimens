rationale: |
  Plan.merge() uses __new__ to bypass __init__ and manually initializes fields:

      merged = Plan.__new__(Plan)
      merged.planner = None
      merged.actions = {}
      merged.messages_by_id = {}
      merged.messages = []

  This is fragile - if __init__ ever adds setup logic, logging, validation, or new
  fields, this code will silently produce broken Plan instances. The hack exists
  because Plan.__init__ requires a planner, but merged plans have no single owner.

  Better alternatives:
  - Make planner optional in __init__: def __init__(self, planner: Planner | None = None)
  - Use a @classmethod factory: Plan.create_merged(plans)
  - Use a dataclass with default_factory for fields
