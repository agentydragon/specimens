rationale: |
  `list_labels` (lines 29-32) and `prune` (lines 97-100) use different
  definitions of "used by filters." `list_labels` counts both
  `add_label_ids` and `remove_label_ids`; `prune` only counts
  `add_label_ids` with a comment saying removals are "typically system
  labels." A user label that appears only in a filter's `removeLabelIds`
  displays as used ("✓") in the list command but is treated as unused and
  deleted by prune. The two commands should agree on the definition.
