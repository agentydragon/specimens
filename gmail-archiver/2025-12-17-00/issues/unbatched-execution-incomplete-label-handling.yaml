rationale: |
  execute_action() in __main__.py has two issues:
  1. Not batched - makes individual API calls per message instead of using Gmail
     batch API for efficiency
  2. Incomplete - only handles INBOX removal specially, silently ignores other
     label removals (has TODO comment on line 116)

  note: execute_action() - unbatched individual calls, ignores non-INBOX label removals
