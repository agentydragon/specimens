rationale: |
  GmailMessage extracts and stores only `body: str` from the raw email, discarding the
  original MIME data. This is premature data reduction - it loses information (HTML body,
  attachments, headers) and prevents fixing parsing bugs or adding new derived fields
  without re-fetching from the API. The model should preserve the raw email bytes and
  derive text content on demand.
