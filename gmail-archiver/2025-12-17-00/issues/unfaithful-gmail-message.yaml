rationale: |
  GmailMessage model only preserves a single `body: str` field (text/plain), discarding
  HTML body, attachments, and MIME structure. Some emails only have HTML, resulting in
  empty body. Plaintext extraction is duplicated in get_messages_batch() and get_message()
  with no HTML fallback.
