  The contextlib.suppress includes AttributeError but this exception cannot occur:
  - email.date is a str field (not optional), so no AttributeError from accessing it
  - datetime.strptime() raises ValueError on parse failure, not AttributeError
  - datetime.replace() is always available on datetime objects

  Even if AttributeError could somehow occur, suppressing it would mask a real bug
  (e.g., typo in attribute name, wrong object type). Suppressing AttributeError is
  almost never correct - it hides programming errors rather than handling expected
  failure modes.
