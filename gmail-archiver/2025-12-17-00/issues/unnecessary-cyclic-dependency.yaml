  PlannedAction and Plan reference the Planner type, but only use planner.name
  for error messages and display grouping. This creates a cyclic dependency
  (Plan references Planner, Planner.plan() returns Plan) that requires forward
  references. Storing planner_name: str instead of planner: Planner would break
  the cycle and simplify the type structure.
