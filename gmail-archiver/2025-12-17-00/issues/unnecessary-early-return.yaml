  Early return for empty list is unnecessary - the following loop would simply
  not execute any iterations and return the same empty result. Adds noise without
  changing behavior.
should_flag: true
occurrences:
- occurrence_id: occ-0
  files:
    gmail_archiver/planners/aliexpress.py:
    - [165, 166]
  note: '"if not messages: return plan" - loop would just be a no-op anyway'
  expect_caught_from:
  - - gmail_archiver/planners/aliexpress.py
