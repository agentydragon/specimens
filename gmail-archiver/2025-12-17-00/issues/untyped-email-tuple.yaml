  extract_batch() takes emails as list[tuple[str, str, str, str]] - a raw tuple
  with no indication of what each element means (message_id, subject, body,
  received_date). Should use one of the existing Pydantic Gmail models like
  GmailMessage, or a subset model if full GmailMessage is too heavy.
