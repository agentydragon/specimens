rationale: |
  GmailMessage has two timestamp fields stored as primitives instead of
  `datetime`: `date: str` (line 23) is the RFC 2822 Date header, parsed
  independently by 5 consumers using 3 different approaches (`strptime`
  with `%z` in anthem_eob/anthem_reimbursement/square, `parsedate_to_datetime`
  in aliexpress, raw string passthrough in dbsa). `internal_date: int`
  (line 24) is epoch milliseconds from the Gmail API, used for sorting in
  one_medical and aliexpress but left as a raw int. Both should be `datetime`
  — parsed once at construction time in the `gmail_client.py` callback that
  builds GmailMessage instances (lines 463-474, 248-256, 529-537). This
  eliminates the duplicated parsing, the divergent format strings, and the
  lossy timezone handling that each planner re-invents.
