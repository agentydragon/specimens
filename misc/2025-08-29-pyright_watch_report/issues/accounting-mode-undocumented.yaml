  Clarify accounting: first‑match vs all‑matches

  Overlapping patterns mean a file may match multiple include/exclude patterns.
  There are at least 2 reasonable valid attribution modes:
  - First‑match wins (config order): attribute a file to the first include pattern that matches. Useful for
  "unique
  additional" counts; order‑sensitive and easy to explain.
  - All‑matches: count a file under every pattern it matches. Useful for coverage/overlap analysis;
  order‑insensitive.

  In the code as written, first‑match wins (order‑sensitive).
  All‑matches would have been a valid alternative; as such, the semantics of attribution stats is not obvious if
  it does
  not state the attribution mode.

  Document the chosen mode in output to avoid confusion.
