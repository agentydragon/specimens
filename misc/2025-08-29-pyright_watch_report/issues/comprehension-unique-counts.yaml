  Use comprehension + seen-update pattern for per-include unique counts to make the code shorter and less nested
  while
  remaining readable and correct.

  Before:

  ```python
  seen: Set[Path] = set()
  per_include_unique: List[Tuple[str, int]] = []
  for pat in include:
      uniq_count = 0
      for p in sorted(kept_union):
          if p in seen:
              continue
          if matches_any(rel(p, root), [pat]):
              uniq_count += 1
              seen.add(p)
      per_include_unique.append((pat, uniq_count))
  ```

  After (shorter/flattened):

  ```python
  per_include_unique: dict[str, set[Path]] = {}
  seen: set[Path] = set()
  for pat in include:
      paths = {p for p in sorted(kept_union) if p not in seen and matches_any(rel(p, root), [pat])}
      per_include_unique[pat] = paths
      seen.update(paths)
  ```

  This primarily reduces nesting and temporary counters while keeping the same semantics.
