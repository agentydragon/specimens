  Lines 232-244 use nested loops with temporary counters for per-include unique counts. Use comprehension +
  seen-update pattern to make the code shorter and less nested while remaining readable and correct.

  After (shorter/flattened):
  ```python
  per_include_unique: dict[str, set[Path]] = {}
  seen: set[Path] = set()
  for pat in include:
      paths = {p for p in sorted(kept_union) if p not in seen and matches_any(rel(p, root), [pat])}
      per_include_unique[pat] = paths
      seen.update(paths)
  ```

  This primarily reduces nesting and temporary counters while keeping the same semantics.
