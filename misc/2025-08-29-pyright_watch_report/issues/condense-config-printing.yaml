  Condense and de-duplicate config printing.

  The code prints the config path with an if/else that can be expressed more concisely without losing clarity. A
  single
  expression using `or` is shorter and avoids branching noise.

  Before:
  ```python
  if cfg_file:
      print(f"config: {cfg_file}")
  else:
      print("config: <not found, using defaults>")
  ```

  After (shorter):
  ```python
  print(f"config: {cfg_file or '<not found, using defaults>'}")
  ```

  This is a readability-focused micro-refactor: it reduces branching for a simple, readable output and keeps
  intent
  clear.
