  Lines 46-51 silently swallow config read/parse errors in `load_config`. The function
  iterates candidate config files and uses `try/except Exception: pass` to skip any that
  fail to read or parse, continuing to the next candidate.

  Problems: silently discards explicit user intent when `--config` is provided, hides real
  configuration errors, broken files indicate issues users should see.

  Fix: let exceptions propagate (fail-fast) or catch and re-raise with context. Do not
  silently continue to the next candidate.
