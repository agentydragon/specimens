  Use collections.Counter for tallying exclude-pattern hits.

  The code currently initializes a mapping of exclude pattern -> 0 and increments counts imperatively. Using
  collections.Counter makes intent clearer, avoids the manual zero-initialization, and expresses that this
  object is for
  counting/histogram purposes.

  Before (excerpt):

  ```python
  # pyright_watch_report.py:
  exclude_hits: dict[str, int] = dict.fromkeys(exclude, 0)
  ...
  for pat in exclude:
      if matches_any(rp, [pat]):
          exclude_hits[pat] += 1
  ```

  After (recommended):

  ```python
  from collections import Counter
  exclude_hits = Counter()
  ...
  exclude_hits.update(pat for pat in exclude if matches_any(rp, [pat]))
  ```

  Counter saves the initialization/default-to-zero and documents intent (counts/histogram) succinctly.
