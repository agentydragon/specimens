rationale: |
  Default exclude patterns are not recursive, so nested files under these directories are still included.

  In pyright_watch_report.py, excludes like "build", "dist", and ".mypy_cache" are used as literal patterns.
  With fnmatch on relative paths, a pattern of "dist" matches only a path named exactly "dist" — it does not
  match
  "dist/foo.py". As a result, files within these directories are not excluded.

  Example: 'dist/foo.py' will not be excluded by the pattern 'dist'.

  Note: Correct fix here would depend on specifics of how the program should behave and potential differences
  in matching semantics between python and pyrightconfig.
