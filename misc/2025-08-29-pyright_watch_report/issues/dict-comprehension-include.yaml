  Use a dict comprehension for per_include_kept to reduce ephemeral state and make intent clear.

  Before (pyright_watch_report.py original):

  ```python
  per_include_kept: Dict[str, int] = {}
  for pat in include:
      per_include_kept[pat] = sum(1 for p in kept_union if matches_any(rel(p, root), [pat]))
  ```

  After (preferred):

  ```python
  per_include_kept: dict[str, int] = {
      pat: sum(1 for p in kept_union if matches_any(rel(p, root), [pat]))
      for pat in include
  }
  ```

  This is clearer, fewer moving parts, and avoids an imperative accumulation pattern.
