rationale: |
  If `load_config` is run with explicit `--config=<file>`, it will *silently skip it* if it's broken and instead
  potentially use other autodiscovered candidates, which (A) *discards user intent* despite the *explicit
  flags*, and
  (B)
  does so *silently*, without announcing any kind of error.

  `load_config` does:

  ```python
  candidates: list[Path] = []
  if config_path:
      candidates.append(config_path)  # <- from explicit commandline arg
  # ... add other candidates ...
  for cand in candidates:
    if cand.is_file():
        try:
            return cand, json.loads(cand.read_text())
        except Exception:
            pass
  ```

  If user explicitly sets `--config` and it fails to load, this silently skips it and moves on to other
  candidates,
  explicitly *and silently* violating user intent.

  If explicitly provided `--config` is not present or fails to load, code must fail fast and surface the error.
  Fallback discovery as in specimen would only be acceptable as "friendly default" when no explicit `--config`
  passed.
  (Motivating scary example: imagine a PII-holding server, with `--config=explicit_config.json`,
  `explicit_config.json`
  having `{"dangerous_pii_exposing_debug_switch"=false}` (type) and silently discovered fallback
  `random_debug_developer_config.json` setting it to `true`).
