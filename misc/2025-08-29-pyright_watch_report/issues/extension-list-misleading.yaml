rationale: |
  Extension list is misleading and duplicated.
  Printed list is hard-coded `.py/.pyi/.pyx` which does not match `CODE_EXTS` (set to `{'.py', '.pyi'}`).

  ```python
  print(f"  of which code (.py/.pyi/.pyx): {total_code}")
  ```

  Derive from one source of truth - `CODE_EXTS` - instead:

  ```python
  print(f"  of which code ({'/'.join(sorted(CODE_EXTS))}): {total_code}")
  ```

  This makes the message not misleading and avoids future drift.
