  Account include and exclude pattern hits symmetrically: accumulate include stats inside the main walk instead
  of reconstructing later. This avoids a second pass and keeps ordering semantics obvious.

  Lines 218 and 236 perform post-hoc reconstruction of include hits from `kept_union`, requiring iteration
  over all kept files again.

  Better approach: gather hits during the scan by tracking which patterns match each file inside the os.walk
  loop. This reduces moving parts and cognitive load needed to understand the pipeline.
