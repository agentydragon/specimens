  Lines 65 and 70 call `normalize_pattern` inside `matches_any` for every match. This scatters the
  responsibility for "patterns should be normalized" all over the code.

  Better approach: Pass input un-normalized patterns (both include/exclude) exactly once through a
  normalization boundary, then consistently deal only with normalized patterns:

  ```python
  include = expand_include_patterns(include)  # returns normalized
  exclude = [normalize_pattern(p) for p in exclude]
  def matches_any(path_rel: str, patterns: Iterable[str]) -> bool:
    return any(
        fnmatch.fnmatch(path_rel, p) or fnmatch.fnmatch("/" + path_rel, p)
        for p in patterns
    )
  ```
