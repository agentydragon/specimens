rationale: |
  When `run_command_streamed` hits a timeout (line 219), it kills the process
  and returns immediately (lines 220-231) without awaiting the stdout/stderr
  forwarding tasks `t1` and `t2` (created at lines 216-217). These tasks
  continue running as orphaned background tasks. Their exceptions (if any)
  are silently lost ("Task exception was never retrieved"), and they hold
  references to the local `stdout_buf`/`stderr_buf` lists and process
  streams. The non-timeout path correctly awaits both tasks (lines 232-235).
